		"paragraph": "Dollar stores used to be the go-to resource for low-income shoppers trying to make their budget stretch a little further . They still are , but their appeal spread to thrifty millennials wanting to spend less on basic items to save more for larger purchases and experiences like travel . But the one-two punch of President Donald Trump s trade tariffs and increasing competition from the likes of Target and Walmart threaten the low-cost market dominance of dollar stores . Click to see the 12 states getting hit hardest by Trump s tariffs . President Trump enacted a 10 percent tariff on $ 200 billion worth of Chinese goods in Sept. 2018 . This was the latest in a series of tariffs on imports , but the first one that meant prices on consumer goods will increase , in addition to impacting industrial product prices . Dollar Tree , which owns Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores , and other discount retailers like Dollar General heavily stock Chinese-made goods . About 42 percent of Dollar Tree products are imported , mostly from China , according to Telsey Advisory Group , a research and consulting firm . Family Dollar imports about 23 percent of its products . About 10 percent of the merchandise at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores will be hit by the tariffs , according to chief executive Gary Philbin s testimony at a hearing before the U.S. trade representatives . Related : ‘ All-American Brands Whose Products Are Actually Made Overseas The 10 percent tariffs that have already been enacted are scheduled to rise to 25 percent on Jan. 1 , 2019 . Even worse for the dollar stores , these tariffs might not be the last . Trump has threatened another round of tariffs if China retaliates against these , which it has shown every indication of doing . Those tariffs would mean virtually anything imported from China could be taxed . See : 10 Ways the Dollar Store Could Actually Be Costing You More This week , Target introduced a line of lower-cost products called Smartly . The line includes necessities such as all-purpose cleaner , body lotion , hand soap , dishwasher powder , toothbrushes , paper plates , razor blades and bath tissue with most selling for less than $ 2 . They come packaged as single items and in small multipacks like four rolls of toilet paper so you do n t have to buy a year s worth to save like you might at a warehouse store . Millennial shoppers like Target , and they like one-stop shopping , according to the Love List Brand Affinity Index put out by Conde Nast and Goldman Sachs . They already choose Target and Walmart for groceries and other household items . If they can find dollar store prices at Target , they might cross dollar stores off their list entirely .

		"paragraph": "Are you counting the days until you become eligible for Social Security benefits at age 62 ? If so , you 're not alone . Sixty-two has long been one of the most common ages at which to claim Social Security benefits -- even as experts repeatedly advise waiting as long as possible . Waiting to claim Social Security benefits is recommended because your benefits are reduced if you retire early -- before full retirement age ( FRA ) -- and they increase up until age 70 if you wait until after FRA . But just because you may get a larger monthly check by waiting to start your benefits does n't mean delaying is the smart choice for everyone . In fact , there are plenty of reasons really smart people take Social Security at 62 . Here are three of them : Image source : Getty Images . When you 're advised to wait to claim Social Security benefits , the reason is simple : You may be able to get more total benefits by delaying . Since your monthly Social Security income goes up if you wait to claim , eventually that higher income will make up for the years of benefits you did n't collect . As long as you live past the point where you break even , total benefits received will be greater . There 's just one problem : Do you know how long you 're going to live ? If you could predict exactly what would happen in the future , chances are good that you would n't need to worry about how big your Social Security benefits will be . But since humans do n't have that power , it 's impossible to know if you would actually be better off waiting . There 's a solid argument to be made that the smarter move is to take the dollars you 're given today , rather than hoping you 'll live long enough to get more hypothetical dollars a decade or more in the future . The older you get , the more likely it is you 'll start to develop health problems . The question is : Would you rather have money now to travel or indulge your hobbies -- or have extra cash later when you 've developed limitations due to medical issues ? Around 92 % of seniors suffer from one or more chronic conditions , and just over 3/4 of seniors suffer from at least two . There 's little sense in waiting to get a benefit that 's a few hundred dollars bigger if you wo n't get that extra money until it 's too late for you to do much with it . If you 're married , the goal should n't be to maximize your Social Security benefits . It should be to maximize the benefits you receive as a couple . Often , this means it makes sense to sacrifice your higher benefits to help boost your spouse 's Social Security income . Let 's say your spouse earned a lot more money than you . If you both want to retire , you may need some Social Security income to live off of . If you can claim your benefits at 62 , your higher-earning spouse could put off claiming . Not only would you end up with a higher total monthly benefit in the long run , but survivor benefits are also structured so that no matter which spouse passes away , the one left behind gets to keep the higher benefits . Alternatively , sometimes one spouse earns a lot of money and the other does n't work or earns very little . In these circumstances , the higher earner may want to claim benefits at 62 in order to make it possible for the other spouse to claim benefits based on the higher earner 's work record . Spousal benefits can equal up to 50 % of the Social Security check received by the primary beneficiary , but these spousal benefits are n't available until the primary beneficiary has begun claiming . If your spouse is waiting on you to start getting his or her own income from Social Security , claiming ASAP could be a good choice . Are you convinced taking Social Security at 62 can be a smart move ? The important thing to remember is that different people benefit from claiming benefits at different times . You need to understand how Social Security benefits are calculated , determine how your retirement age affects your benefits , and make a choice that makes sense for your family and finances .

		"paragraph": "Politicians and celebrities took to their Twitter accounts on Sunday to honor the memory of Heather Heyer , sharing thanks for her fight against racism and bigotry , as well as pledges to continue the fight in her honor . Former Vice President Joe Biden wrote , Today we honor the memory of Heather Heyer , whose spirit we see in every person who stands up to reject hatred and bigotry . Other elected officials across the country echoed Biden s sentiments . Cynthia Nixon , who is running for governor in New York and who famously starred as Miranda in the Sex and the City series , wrote , Heather Heyer was murdered for daring to stand up to a group of white supremacists that came together in Charlottesville to protest America s greatest asset : our diversity . Bernice King , the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr. , quoted Heyer s mother . Actor and activist Alyssa Milano also posted a tribute , as did activist Shaun King . Heyer will not soon be forgotten , if her mother , Susan Bro , has anything to say about it . She has spent the past year traveling around the country to promote the Heather Heyer Foundation , launched within days of her death , to carry on her daughter s legacy of opposition to racism and to help her cope with her horrifying loss . She s also attempting to carry on Heyer s legacy by encouraging people to become active in the face of injustice . Speaking to Yahoo News , Bro quoted her daughter : If you re not outraged , you re not paying attention . We have to have a lot of difficult conversations with people that we would not normally want to have conversations with , she says . And be willing to listen to what they re saying , think about it and then respond . You do n t need to respond immediately . You do n t need to respond with hate . You do n t need to respond defensively . You need to respond rationally , and I think that s what s gon na move the country forward . On Aug. 12 , Bro is planning to lay flowers on the spot on Fourth Street where her daughter died . She s also scheduled to speak at an NAACP event that evening .

		"paragraph": "Did you ever want to caddie for a PGA Tour winner ? Well , this was your chance . And you probably blew it . Steven Bowditch took to Twitter on Monday night to seek someone to carry his bag at this week s John Deere Classic . And he did it in the self-deprecating fashion we ve come to expect from the two-time PGA Tour winner as he gave himself only a 1-percent chance of making it to Sunday 's final round . Talk about the ultimate temp job . Although , it does n t necessarily have to be so temporary . One responder asked whether he could also caddie for Bowditch at next week s Open Championship if the Aussie happens to win this week and qualify for the season s third major . Without doubt . Not even a question , Bowditch replied . RELATED : Steven Bowditch is still the funniest PGA Tour pro on Twitter By Tuesday afternoon , Bowditch had settled on his caddie , a 17-year-old local named Elias , who gave a sweet and savvy ( \" I love Australia \" ) response . After winning the Byron Nelson in 2015 and representing the Internationals at the President Cup later that year , Bowditch has struggled mightily with his golf game . He has n't made a cut in five tournaments this season and has failed to make the weekend in 35 of his past 37 starts . However , the talent is still in there somewhere , and there is still the potential for a big payday for both him and the lucky looper . Standard PGA Tour caddie payouts are roughly 5 percent of tournament earnings for a made cut , 7 percent for a top 10 , and 10 percent of a win . This week 's winner will make more than $ 1 million , so you do the math for what the winning caddie takes home . Not a bad week 's work -- if you can get it . Good luck , Elias .

		"paragraph": "Warning : This interview for the The Other Side episode of The Walking Dead contains spoilers . Rosita and Sasha fought , made up ( sorta ) , bonded ( sorta ) , and declared they had each other s backs . But now they re separated once again , this time by Sasha s attempt to spare her new friend s life during their suicide mission to kill Negan inside the Saviors Sanctuary compound . At the end of The Other Side and with just two episodes remaining in Season 7 Sasha s inside the Sanctuary , Rosita s outside staring at a man who may be friend ( Daryl ) or foe ( Dwight ) , and neither is sure what the deal is with Eugene , who refused their help to escape and voluntarily returned to his Sanctuary home . Christian Serratos , who plays Rosita , talked to Yahoo TV about her character s big Thelma & Louise-ish adventure with Sasha , including what prompted her to go to her romantic rival for help , how she felt about seeing the necklace she made for Abraham on Sasha , why Rosita spilled such personal details to Sasha , and what she thinks about the bow-carrying mystery man who we think may be the key to the new strategy she says Rosita will adopt for the rest of the season . Congratulations . Those were great scenes between you and Sonequa Martin-Green . Yeah , thanks . I was really excited and nervous about it . What made you nervous ? Because we were seeing a little bit more of who [ Rosita ] was . We were getting a little bit of her backstory , which we had n t before , so it was something that I wanted to do justice to . I wanted to work hard and make sure I was putting in all the elements that I felt needed to be there , that the fans wanted there . That scene in the warehouse is my favorite of the episode , and I think it may be the best Rosita scene ever . We really get to see her be vulnerable , which is very rare . Yeah , and I really respect that about Rosita . No matter what , even when we do see her be vulnerable , that wall … she somehow gets it back up , but I think that s really cool . She s got that really tough exterior . I think that s probably a lot of who she was before the apocalypse as well , and it was just intensified when the world came crumbling down . But it was really cool to be a little more vulnerable . She s been so angry and so focused on revenge for most of the season , more than anyone except maybe Daryl . Has that been tough to play , being in that mindset all season ? It has been tough , but it s also been really fun , and I know that makes me sound a little bit like a sociopath , but I had so much fun with the struggle . This work can be a struggle sometimes . It can be really hard to get to the places that you need to get to to show an honest performance , you know what I mean ? It could so often be surface , and that s what I think all actors try to avoid , any sort of emotion being just surface , because you re not going to affect another individual that way . It has to be real to you in that moment , which can also be a little destructive . I mean , after that first episode [ of Season 7 ] … all of us gave 150 percent , and it s hard to turn off . When you go home , you re still a little bit traumatized . We were all traumatized from that episode . It took a lot longer than just the end of the workday . There are a few 16-hour days in an episode , and we shoot episodes very quickly , quicker than I think most shows right now . We do our own stunts . We re running . In Atlanta , it s , like , 112 degrees , and we re running on freeways and reversing cars and jumping over fences . We want to do these things . We re all crazy kids who want to play pretend and do all these fun things , but then you realize after one or two takes how grueling it is . So we re very grateful for the crew and the production that we have to keep us as safe as they keep us and as healthy as they can , and we re also very grateful for people like stunt drivers , because there s some s *** that we have to [ sit out ] . Did you do any of the great stunt where Rosita hot-wires the car and maneuvers it out of the fenced yard in reverse ? I did n t do any of the driving . We were in the car . It was a rig . It was dangerous then . But there s also things that , as crazy as we all are … we all want to shoot the guns and blow up buildings and things like that , but they re not going to let us hurt ourselves , so they bring in the real professionals when they have to . What does it take for Rosita to go to the hilltop and ask Sasha for help ? That s really opening herself up given everything that has happened . Oh , yeah . She does n t have to swallow her pride , but she knows that the only person maybe as motivated as she is right now is the person who also lost a love of hers . [ Sasha ] lost her man . And while , yes , that was the man we saw Rosita with , the bond that she and Abraham had was different , and it was larger for many different reasons . So I think Rosita had confidence that Sasha cared enough about Abraham to want to go with her . Does she believe she needs Sasha s help ? I do n t know that that s playing any part right now . I think we ve seen how headstrong Rosita can be about a mission . That was how she was introduced to the show , [ as part of ] a mission to get Eugene to Washington . So I think right now she s thinking of the mission more than anything , and I think she knows that Sasha could be an asset . Rosita spots the necklace she made for Abraham , the one Sasha is now wearing . It obviously bothers her . But ultimately does the fact that Sasha is wearing it also signal to her that yes , Sasha loved Abraham too , and does that help soften her toward Sasha eventually ? No , I think Rosita knew Sasha had true love for Abraham way before then . I think , if anything , the necklace just pissed her off , because it s weird that what she is wearing is not an indication of Abraham it s really an indication of Rosita s love for Abraham . So it s very weird that she s wearing it , and even stranger that she keeps it on after [ Rosita tells her she made it ] , but that s none of [ Rosita s ] business , I guess . Did Sasha know that s where the necklace came from before Rosita said it ? Or did she keep it because she knew it was Abraham s ? I think she keeps it because she knows it s Abraham s , but the second that Rosita tells her , Do you like it ? I made it , that s when it should have come off . But I think that s because and we ll never know , because we re not in an apocalypse , but she s keeping it on because that s all she has left of him . And that just shows the love that she had for Abraham , that despite the fact that Rosita made it , she s still willing to keep it near and dear to her heart because she loved him . One of the other great scenes between Rosita and Sasha is the exchange about the best approach for killing Negan . Should it be to go after him from the outside or from the inside ? They re both right potentially both plans have pluses and minuses . They want the same things , they re both capable . It s not a surprise that Abraham liked them both , because the bottom line is that they are similar : very tough , capable women who are survivors , and who are very stubborn . That is true , and we ve seen the parallels with these two characters for a long time , all of us as a cast . So it definitely was n t surprising at all that he was seeking a relationship with [ Sasha ] . I love these two characters , because they are so different , they have different ways of doing things . And we ve seen them with their reaction to Abraham s death : Rosita does not handle it well , and she gets very hard , way harder than we ve seen her be , and Sasha tried to find a common thing . She tries to relate to Rosita , is hoping that she is going to open up more , but instead , it made her more introverted . I think when Sasha sees Rosita finally open up , I think that s something she s maybe been wanting to happen for a while . What is the thing that ultimately makes Rosita soften toward Sasha when they re together in the factory , makes her tell her about her past ? She said she s never told anyone those things about herself . So why Sasha , and why now ? I think it s a lot of things . I think a lot of it is her knowing that this is potentially a suicide mission for herself and this might be the only time she gets to say it out loud . These might be her final words . But I think she also knows that Sasha has been making an effort with her , so , in Rosita terms , I think she s throwing her a bone . What is Rosita thinking when Eugene refuses her and Sasha s help to escape ? Is she assuming he s a traitor ? Is she assuming he s a coward ? Or does she think that maybe he s trying to protect her and Sasha to get them to go away and save themselves ? I think she just thinks he s an idiot , which is something that she thinks quite often of him , but he can be an idiot . He s also the smartest idiot in the world . We ve seen what he s capable of , his intelligence , his desire to stay alive and his drive to stay alive , and the fact that he s not as useless as people thought in the very beginning . That thought went away very quickly when he started saving people s lives . At this point , I do n t think she puts anything past him . I do n t know if she knows that this is all for survival . I do n t know if she knows that he s gone forever , but it s going to be interesting to see how she reacts when she finds out exactly which way this is going to go with him . She and Sasha tell each other they have their backs when they re about to go on this mission , and they both do , although I think Sasha meant that in a way that Rosita did n t expect . Sasha is trying to save Rosita s life . She s telling her it s not her time when she goes through that fence , which , as you just said , is likely a suicide mission . We see Rosita very angry she s crying . Is she sad that she thinks Sasha has gone on this suicide mission ? Is she also angry that Sasha duped her and is leaving her out of the revenge plan ? I think it s a little bit of anger . I think it s frustration . I think she needed to see that through , and she s being robbed of it . But I think bigger than that , it s guilt . That s what I think . And what s great is that people can interpret it in any way they want … but I feel , as a fan and then as an individual , I think she s feeling guilty because [ Sasha ] is essentially saving her life , and she s wasted a lot of time [ being angry ] . That s what I think she s thinking . Being angry at Sasha ? Maybe , yeah . At the end , she sees someone with a bow standing nearby . That changes her immediate reaction . Yeah , but I do n t know if we know exactly what she s seeing , and I think that s on purpose . I think there s a little hesitation , because it could be somebody that she s very familiar with . But why do n t we know for sure ? I do n t think she can see who it is . I think the audience maybe knows who it is … I think us watching it , we see something that she does n t . She s running away , and then she stops . We do n t know for sure who she sees someone with a bow , could be Daryl , who had just asked Jesus where she was , could maybe be Dwight , because Eugene had just ordered the Saviors to look for walkers but is it safe to assume she is n t going to just leave Sasha there in the Sanctuary without making some attempt to help her and save her ? Rosita never wants to give up or to accept a failure or loss , so I think there s definitely going to be action . I definitely think there s going to be a new strategy now . That s what we re going to see next . What else can you say about the final two episodes of the season ? Every year I feel like we try to outdo ourselves , we try to raise the bar , we try to give the audience more of a roller-coaster ride , more colors , more feelings . And so far , I think we ve succeeded . So I feel like more than ever , this is going to be a bigger , badder , more explosive season finale . I think whatever happens , whether we win or lose or people die , I think there is always a renewed life to this show , and it s only going to be that much more fascinating for the next season . ‘ The Walking Dead airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on AMC .

		"paragraph": "Through the first 4 games of this season , there had n't been a lot of Power Ranking movement when it came to the Bears . They were winning games , but it was n't super convincing and when your biggest concern through 25 % of the season is your franchise quarterback , people are going to be skeptical . The best cure for apathy ? To stay , try throwing 6 TDs and throttling Tampa Bay by 38 points . That opened some people 's eyes , and the Power Rankings that come rolling in this week are reflecting that . Here 's what they 're saying : Ours - # 10 , up 1 : Trubisky ! If the Bears can even get 1/2 of that production from him going forward , they 're a legitimately scary team . NFL.com - # 8 , up 9 : Now that was the performance Bears fans have been waiting for ... No , not the new Monsters of the Midway making the visiting Bucs look silly . Rather , it was their sophomore quarterback throwing for 354 yards and six touchdowns . Mitchell Trubisky 's performance was legit . SB Nation - # 11 , up 3 : The Bears also looked great last week with not only the defense impressing , but Mitchell Trubiskythrowing SIX touchdown passes ( and zero interceptions ) in the win over the Buccaneers . For The Win - # 15 , N/A : The defense looks great , but look at the offenses it 's played since Aaron Rodgers shredded this unit on one leg . Let 's pump the brakes a little on the Bears hype train . Bleacher Report : # 5 , N/A Sports Illustrated - # 12 , up 7 : Khalil Mack is the front-runner for Defensive Player of the Year , and would be in the conversation for MVP at the quarter mark of the season if that award did n't go to an offensive player every year . USA Today - # 14 , up 4 : Khalil Mack MVP train ? Chicago 's newest transcendent linebacker has at least one sack and forced fumble in every game for first-place team . Sporting News - # 11 , up 5 : The Bears got their breakout game from Mitchell Trubisky and it made it even easier for the defense to dominate . Matt Nagy has them legitimately in the NFC hunt , one quarter away from being perfect . Yahoo Sports - # 9 , up 8 : In a weird scheduling quirk , the Bears have four games in a row against the AFC East after their bye . The good news is the AFC East stinks , and the one tough game against the Patriots is in Chicago . I 'm not expecting the Bears to win all four , but it 's not entirely crazy either .

		"paragraph": "Law enforcement lost one of its most famous members on Jan. 6 , when Dave Toschi a detective with the San Francisco Police Department passed away after a lengthy illness . Toschi was a brash , larger-than-life personality , even by the standards of his city , and he received his most famous assignment in 1969 when , alongside partner Bill Armstrong , he was tasked with handling the Zodiac serial-killer case . That , in turn , led to national prominence and attracted the attention of Hollywood , which soon used him as the template for two of its most memorable police-force protagonists and , eventually , immortalized him in one of the new millennium s best films . I m speaking , of course , about David Fincher s 2007 masterpiece Zodiac , in which Toschi is played by Mark Ruffalo . It s one of Ruffalo s finest performances , even if it sidesteps a less noble aspect of the man s official conduct ( which is noted in the Associated Press s obituary ) namely , that Toschi was removed from the never-solved Zodiac case in 1978 after confessing to writing anonymous letters that praised his work to the San Francisco Chronicle . Nonetheless , while that stunt got him into trouble with his superiors , it hardly mattered to Tinseltown , which twice used Toschi as inspiration for a go-for-broke cop : Steve McQueen s Bullitt ( 1968 ) and Clint Eastwood s Dirty Harry ( 1971 ) . For the former , McQueen actually shadowed Toschi as he worked , basing his character s fast-driving habits on the real-life sports car-loving detective . And though Eastwood reportedly did n t do likewise , his Dirty Harry tasked with hunting down a Zodiac-style killer was clearly modeled after Toschi as well . In fact , the connection between Toschi and Dirty Harry was outright underlined in Zodiac , when Ruffalo s Toschi is approached in a theater while watching the Eastwood film , at which point he states that they re already making movies about his life . As Ruffalo noted in an Instagram post Thursday , he too spent time with Toschi while shooting Zodiac , and developed an appreciation for his subject . The real Toschi later admitted to the Chronicle that although he enjoyed Fincher s film , it was n t easy for him to sit through it : I thought Ruffalo did a good job . I enjoy it , but it depresses me . After I watch it I get angry at myself because I could n t close the case . That inability to nab the Zodiac killer haunted him for the rest of his life resulting in ulcers , and compelling him to return to the scene of the crimes every year on their Oct. 11 anniversary . However , as evidenced by the three movies that came to life because of his career , his formidable Hollywood legacy remains an open-and-shut case . Read more from Yahoo Entertainment :",

		"paragraph": "This news has been getting a lot of attention lately : China s economy is now larger than America s , if you exclude exchange rates and other factors . And even if measured the most conventional way -- using total GDP -- China s economy is bound to outgrow America s eventually , since the Middle Kingdom has three times the population of the United States and a rapidly swelling consumer class . China has become Americans favorite bogeyman , even more than Russia and its sinister leader , Vladimir Putin . To many people , the rise of China is synonymous with America s decline . For the last four years , more than half of people polled have told Gallup that China is the world s most powerful economy , with just 32 % saying the U.S. is tops in the latest survey . In 2000 , 65 % named America most powerful , with Japan second , at 16 % . Only 10 % named China as No. 1 back then . These worries are easily refuted , as several commentators have done in response to hysteria over China s growth . For one thing , income and GDP are far higher in the U.S. when measured on a per capita basis , which is a much better gauge of wealth , prosperity and economic power than the total amount of output . America may still be the most innovative nation in the world , as well , with Silicon Valley the epicenter of digital technology that s transforming the entire planet . The United States has many other advantages China lacks , such as terrific universities , bounteous natural resources , dynamic capital markets and more-or-less effective rule of law . We ve been squandering some of those advantages through fractious politics and self-destructive greed , yet it has been the United States , and no other country , leading the world out of a deep global economic slump . Instead of worrying about who might be bigger , we d be a lot better off worrying about how to remain productive and efficient . A big economy , for one thing , does n t guarantee high living standards . GDP per capita , in fact , is highest in small nations , with Luxembourg , Norway and Qatar ranking 1 , 2 and 3 , according to the World Bank . The U.S. ranks No. 10 , with GDP per capita of about $ 53,000 . Germany is 18th ( $ 45,000 ) , Japan is 23rd ( $ 38,500 ) , and China is 70th ( $ 6,800 ) . [ Get the Latest Market Data and News with the Yahoo Finance App ] In the business world , size can be an impediment to profitability . Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ ) is currently trying to break itself into two , because its CEO and many shareholders feel two separate companies could perform better than one monolithic whole . General Motors ( GM ) foundered when it had eight automotive divisions more than twice as many as any competitor but is cruising now that it has only four . Economists frequently point out that the most dynamic companies are n t big established ones , but fast-growing younger ones , which is where most job creation comes from . What Americans should be worried about is recapturing the dynamism that seems to have leaked out of the U.S. economy during the last decade or so . Too many adults are sputtering in their careers or sitting on the sidelines , out of work . A lot of them blame Washington for their predicament with justification but there s also a lot of evidence people are n t doing enough to spring themselves out of a rut . Millions of Americans have lived beyond their means for years , leaving themselves shackled with debt . Companies ca n t find enough workers to fill certain middle-skill jobs such as sales reps and tradesmen , partly because people are n t willing to go where the work is or get the required training . China is n t a superpower , but it may become one , and in some ways it s already a tough competitor . Its military has become assertive in the South China Sea and elsewhere . Its state-owned companies have aggressively formed alliances in Africa , Latin America and other up-and-coming regions the West tends to neglect . China also has large vulnerabilities rampant corruption , many hollow companies propped up by state spending , and a spotty legal code that s not ready for prime time . It will solve some of those problems and trip over others , just as other nations , including the United States , have done . China will only overtake America , however , if we get too sclerotic and slow to maintain our lead . That could certainly happen , if venal politicians , Wall Street charlatans and overentitled , underinformed citizens pursue self-interest beyond the point of national interest . If that happens , the size of our economy wo n t have anything to do with it . But the size of our egos will . Rick Newman s latest book is Rebounders : How Winners Pivot From Setback To Success .

A fun , light adventure featuring everyone s favorite Wookie and his human , Solo dove deep into Star Wars lore and nostalgia , crafting the best version of Han Solo s origins . ( And we can say that with some authority , since we ve read all the Legends novels . ) Where Rogue One favored fan service and plot over consistent characters , Solo let its charismatic characters carry audiences along a pulpy adventure . There s a good chance we wo n t get a sequel , but we certainly would n t mind a Lando film starring Donald Glover . Adam Lance Garcia 19 . Three Identical Strangers This year s entry in the always popular stranger than fiction subgenre of documentaries recounts the unlikely story of Eddy Galland , David Kellman , and Bobby Safran , three separated-at-birth brothers who met one another for the first time as grown-ups . That s already a fascinating hook for a feature film , along with the fact that the reunited triplets rode the wave of early - 80s tabloid television to become media sensations . But the real story of Tim Wardle s impeccably paced account reveals itself midway through the narrative , as the brothers attempts to research their own origin story leads them down dark and in some cases tragic paths . Ethan Alter 18 . Game Night Thanks to a killer cast ( Rachel McAdams ! Jason Bateman ! Kyle Chandler ! Jesse Plemons ! ) and a rock-solid screenplay that they should teach in comedy screenwriting courses , Game Night is one of the most consistently enjoyable major studio comedies in recent memory . Right from its opening sequence , this tale of an ordinary game night that spins wildly out of control sets itself apart with a distinct visual style and clever camera trickery that never lets up . Also , the sight of McAdams singing karaoke into a loaded gun belongs on her career highlights reel . Brett Arnold 17 . The Endless Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead return to the stomping ground of their indie debut Resolution for a head-spinning supernatural/sci-fi drama about two brothers ( played by the writer-directors ) who decide to revisit the remote California UFO sex cult they abandoned years earlier . Such a premise might imply an ensuing tale of unspeakable horrors , but the filmmaking duo instead take the story in wholly unexpected directions , even as they ground their story in the believably prickly relationship of their sibling main characters , whose own frayed bond is central to the film s time-space convolutions . Like their prior efforts , it s risk-taking but confident genre cinema . Nick Schager 16 . The Rider Chlo Zhao s no-budget indie could almost be called a documentary because of the way it films non-actors in their native territory in South Dakota . But a more accurate description is that it s a dramatization of actual events that just so happens to star the people including former rodeo rider Brady Jandreau on whom the story is based . By any definition , The Rider is a beautiful and devastating account about what happens when people follow their dreams only to have them slip away for good . B.A. 15 . RBG Julie Cohen and Betsy West s illuminating look at Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg ( aka the Notorious RBG ) succeeds in both facets of its two-pronged approach : It celebrates the judge s long and groundbreaking career , and it provides a reverential look at how the Brooklyn native became a feminist ( and pop-culture ! ) icon . As a bonus , the hit doc is a charming love story between the tireless justice and her supportive late husband , Martin D. Ginsburg . This is a big year for RBG at the movies : In the fall , we ll see Oscar nominee Felicity Jones ( The Theory of Everything ) portray Ginsburg in the biopic On the Basis of Sex . Kevin Polowy 14 . Tully The creative forces behind the bold , bracing dark comedy Young Adult writer Diablo Cody , director Jason Reitman , and star Charlize Theron reunite for another searingly incisive dive into one woman s troubled psyche . Theron plays Marlo , a harried mother of three in desperate need of at least one good night s sleep . Enter the titular night nanny ( Mackenzie Davis ) , who helps Marlo get some rest while also awakening potent memories of what her life was like pre-parenthood . Cody s unnervingly unsentimental script deftly navigates fault lines that real moms and dads have almost certainly experienced , making Tully a difficult but ultimately cathartic watch . Just maybe not on Date Night . E.A. 13 . Deadpool 2 The first Deadpool was the surprise hit of 2016 , and the self-aware sequel does all it can to double down on everything its predecessor did , all while admitting to the audience , Yes , we know this is n t as good as the original , but let s be honest … what sequel is ? While the controversial opening scene of the film left a slightly sour taste in our mouths , Deadpool 2 finds its voice in Act 2 , thanks to the antagonistic team-up of Ryan Reynolds and Josh Brolin , who apparently is now required to be in every Comic Book Cinematic Universe . The movie also ends with what might be the most meta ( and best ) post-credits sequence we ve ever seen . A.L.G. 12 . You Were Never Really Here Joaquin Phoenix s collaboration with Scottish auteur Lynne Ramsay provides further proof that he may be the best American actor working in cinema today . As a haunted military veteran now working as a for-hire man-of-action capable of finding and rescuing missing young girls , the actor exudes volatile intensity and soul-deep hurt that works in perfect concert with Ramsay s efficiently expressionistic direction . You Were Never Really Here is violent not only literally but emotionally and builds toward nightmarish confrontations that are almost as bracing as its leading man s unforgettable performance . N.S. 11 . Hereditary Ari Aster s nightmare-inducing first feature is one of those heavily hyped festival debuts that you assume ca n t possibly be as great as everyone says it is . Except in this case , the movie delivers . While general audiences were thrown for a loop by the deceptive marketing ( resulting in the movie s D-plus Cinemascore ) , horror fans will love that the film is n t a typical jump-scare horror programmer . Instead , Hereditary is a movie about grief , family , and the inevitability of your genetics can you ever truly outrun what s in your blood ? Oh , yeah , and the third act is pure satanic insanity . B.A. 10 . Incredibles 2 It s not as incredible as its 2004 predecessor , but they ca n t all be Toy Story 3 . Brad Bird s long-anticipated Parr family reunion is , however , a worthy follow-up that starts just moments after the first and feels stylistically and tonally perfectly in tune with the original film . Bird and company counter the fact that the freshness of seeing an animated superhero family has waned with the emergence of Elastigirl ( Holly Hunter ) handling the bulk of the crimefighting while Mr. Incredible handles more domestic battles at home . The real star of the show , though , is Baby Jack-Jack . Give this tot a spinoff or , better yet , have him fight The Boss Baby . K.P. 9 . Annihilation Alex Garland is one of science-fiction cinema s most original and daring voices as evidenced by Annihilation , a film that begins in somewhat traditional territory before venturing off into uninhibited insanity . Grief-stricken biologist Natalie Portman joins a team of experts ( including Tessa Thompson , Gina Rodriguez , and Jennifer Jason Leigh ) on a trip into a hot-zone known as the Shimmer , where mutated horrors await . Garland imbues his hypnotic material with a heavy dose of profound existential dread , and the finale is so deliriously out-there that it achieves a measure of trippy 2001-grade terror and wonder . N.S. 8 . Blockers Here s a movie that fulfills its most necessary requisite of being uproariously funny no matter how high-concept it goes while also managing to remain socially relevant . As three parents ( the reliably amusing John Cena , Leslie Mann , and Ike Barinholtz ) embark on a midnight run to prevent their prom-going teenage daughters ( the excellent Geraldine Viswanathan , Kathryn Newton , and Gideon Adlon ) from losing their virginity , we re asked why females are held to such a different standard when it comes to their sexual awakenings . Come for the butt-chugging scene , stay for the touching coming-out story . K.P. 7 . Sorry to Bother You Rapper Boots Riley makes the leap to feature filmmaking without missing a beat . While the gleefully absurdist , and pointedly political , Sorry to Bother You which opens in theaters July 6 but has been playing the festival circuit since January displays the influence of wild social satires like Putney Swope and Being John Malkovich , it has its own distinct voice that speaks directly to our present day . With Get Out ‘ s Lakeith Stanfield as his muse , Riley deftly ( and hilariously ) explores the intersection between race , class , culture and power in Trump-era America , building to a final twist that you definitely wo n t see coming . E.A. 6 . First Reformed It may seem crazy to mention Paul Schrader s latest film , First Reformed , in the same breath as his seminal screenplay for Taxi Driver , but you d be hard-pressed to come up with a more fitting comparison when the credits roll . The story of a priest ( Ethan Hawke ) coming to terms with the world we live in , this small-scale story slowly builds to a shocking conclusion with devastating implications . It s Schrader s first full-fledged masterpiece of the 21st century and a hell of a left turn from the film that preceded it , his little-seen ( and totally crazy ) crime movie , Dog Eat Dog . B.A. 5 . Avengers : Infinity War Let s be honest , Infinity War is n t the best Marvel film , but it is , without a doubt , the MCU s crowning achievement … and not simply for breaking nearly every box-office record . After 10 years and 18 films , the Kevin Feige-led Marvel Studios successfully crafted a shared universe that allowed for Dr. Strange , Iron Man , and Spider-Man to plausibly team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy and fight Thanos . Whether the contractually questionable deaths at the end of the film worked for you or not depends of your ability to suspend your disbelief . But with the shape of the MCU fundamentally altered at least for the time being we left the theater wondering just how the Avengers will eventually save the day . A.L.G. 4 . Wo n t You Be My Neighbor ? Even in these divisive times , almost every American can agree that Fred Rogers is a gosh-darned national treasure . For more than three decades , the soft-spoken minister turned broadcaster entertained and educated millions of children through his iconic PBS series , Mr. Rogers Neighborhood . Director Morgan Neville traces the arc of Rogers s life with plenty of surprising revelations and a sweetly sentimental appreciation for the good works he performed on a daily basis . Bring tissues , because there will be tears . E.A. 3 . Paddington 2 It was true in January and remains true today : 2018 s finest sequel is Paddington 2 . Returning director Paul King resists the urge to force his gentle ursine star into a bigger , louder adventure , instead keeping Paddington ( voiced by Ben Whishaw ) and his adopted family grounded in a richly emotional story that makes room for plenty of veddy British humor , scene-stealing supporting turns from Hugh Grant and Brenden Gleeson , and inventive storybook-style visual tricks . Audiences may have slept on this gem during its stateside theatrical release , but it should enjoy a long afterlife as a children s bedtime movie . N.S. 2 . A Quiet Place John Krasinski s third directorial effort is his finest to date a supernatural thriller that exploits its central gimmick for lean , mean suspense . In an America ravaged by vicious monsters with excellent hearing , humanity must stay completely silent to remain undetected . That scenario is the starting point for the story of a family ( led by Krasinski and real-life wife Emily Blunt ) trying to survive in the aftermath of a horrific tragedy . Bolstered by excellent performances and a script that does n t overstay its welcome , A Quiet Place exploits sound and silence for consistent , canny scares . N.S. 1 . Black Panther Is Marvel s most successful movie yet also its very best ? Quite possibly . Ryan Coogler s stunning superhero drama transcends mere cinema , becoming not just a pop-cultural phenomenon but a full-on movement . As a film first , though , it s big , bright , bold , intense , awe-inspiring , evocative , and deeply profound , especially in its cultural clash between our hero T Challa ( Chadwick Boseman ) and Killmonger ( an Oscar-worthy Michael B. Jordan ) , the African-American mercenary whose barely contained rage , driven by the oppression of black people in the U.S. , makes him one of the most complex and tragic antagonists of our time . Wakanda forever . K.P. Read more from Yahoo Entertainment :",

		"paragraph": "Warning : This recap for the season finale of The Bachelorette contains spoilers . Well , rose lovers , we and our beloved bachelorette have made it to the end of this journey . As for the happiness of the aforementioned ending … well , I think by now we ve all learned to reserve judgment on that until at least six to eight months after the finale . But before we can get to the proposal , first we must go to the Tealight Candle Thunderdome , where Chris Harrison and Team Bachelorette have compelled Rachel to sit on the stage and live-blog her own finale for our viewing pleasure . Can I leave ? asks the Bachelorette , not joking at all . Sorry , toots , but you re stuck with us . Now let s go back even further two weeks , to be exact , to Rachel and Peter s emotional impasse in Rioja , Spain . In the next , basically , week at this point , what if I m not ready to say , ‘ Will you marry me ? Peter asks the tearful Bachelorette . She has no ready answer other than , I m trying not to cry . Rachel needs a relationship that she knows will move past the girlfriend-boyfriend stage , and it does not look as though Peter will be able to give it to her . Still , Peter urges Rachel not to let the focus on a televised proposal scuttle their relationship , which he says is worth pursing . It s a nice , reasonable sentiment , but nice and reasonable are not at all what Team Bachelorette wants at this point and they ve successfully impressed their desires upon Rachel . So what is she going to do ? Give him the Fantasy Suite card , of course ! After all , Rachel says she and Peter have a lot that we have to talk about , and what better place to do it than a luxury , camera-rree zone that also has room service ? The Bachelorette is hopeful . Maybe there will be clarity in the morning , she says . I ll say : That s about as clear as things are gon na get , gurl . I really feel like the time that Peter and I spent alone made our relationship better , says Rachel . But we re still on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to a proposal . Make up your mind , girl ! It s time for the rose ceremony . … Wait , what s this ? Omg , I forgot we still have to get through Bryan s overnight date ! This season s time-shifting shenanigans have me all kinds of turned around . [ Heavy sigh . ] All right , let s just get this over with . Rachel and Bryan ride on horseback through the vineyard to a rustic outdoor bar , where they stop for some wine and a strained conversation . Let s listen in : Rachel is clearly distracted , mainly because Peter messed with [ her ] mind and now she does n t have a clear handle on which guy to send packing at the rose ceremony . Over dinner , Bryan admits that their date felt a little off , because he felt a different energy than Rachel but the Bachelorette apologizes and assures him that her spacey energy does n t have anything to do with him . All right you crazy kids , off to the Fantasy Suite you go . We re back on track . The chemistry is hotter than ever , Bryan announces . Any doubts we had about each other were all answered last night . Okay , okay , okay . Now can we get to the final rose ceremony , please ? The windup is all about how Rachel knows she wants a proposal at the end , how she knows Peter might not give it to her , and how she has to just follow her heart , and so that means the last man to be sent to the Reject SUV is . … Though Eric was ready to propose , Rachel says she does n t personally feel like he s ready for marriage . By contrast , Peter is ready for marriage … he s just not yet ready to propose and for now , I guess , that seems like a better option B to Rachel . On the Bye-Bye Bench , Rachel gives Eric the I love you , but I m not in love with you speech , and his response is pure class . I just want to say thank you for being open , for allowing me to be open . … Thank you for allowing me to get what I need , and God willing , I promise you , I know you re going to get what you want , says Eric . And truth be told , I will always love you . As Rachel puts it , No bitterness , no hate , no regrets . And that s why Eric is such an amazing and beautiful person . Just a thought . After sending Eric home , Team Bachelorette embracing the let s make this the Before , During , and After the Final Rose concept brings Eric on stage to reunite with Rachel and discuss their breakup . What could have been a tense encounter is once again completely cordial , as Eric remains gentlemanly and mature about the situation . You had to do it , he tells Rachel , asking her whether she s happy . Of course she says yes , and turns the question around to him . Eric assures her that he s phenomenal and Rachel is n t kidding when she says , You look phenomenal ! Just look at him : Back to the show : Now that we re down to the final two , both Bryan and Peter know that Peter is the underdog . When Rachel said she wants a proposal , she looked directly in my eyes , admits Peter . Why ca n t I be ready right now to propose to this woman ? Fortunately for Peter , he still has the Last Chance Date … which is literally the last date , too , because Bryan is up first . If I had a ring , I would propose to Rachel right now , Bryan reminds us . He and Rachel cuddle and smooch as they float over the gorgeous Spanish countryside in a hot air balloon a vista that is made slightly less gorgeous by the sight of Bryan repeatedly jabbing his tongue into Rachel s mouth . Once back on the ground , the Bachelorette tells us that her mind is not yet made up . Perhaps sensing this , Bryan re-ups his sales pitch . To be honest , I think it would be a mistake if you did n t choose me , he says . I would be devastated . I would be the most heartbroken I ve ever been in my life if I lost you . And she loves it . When it comes time for the traditional last date hotel gift shop offering , Bryan gives Rachel a homemade Spanish dictionary , with personalized phrases such as husband , wife , forever , and leap of faith . Can Peter top that ? Let s find out . The color-coordinated couple meets outside the beautiful Monasterio de Valvanera , where they stroll the sacred grounds and explore the church and its statuary . Inside they meet a kindly monk , who inquires if they are promised as a couple . They respond with some mumbled maybes , so the holy man goes on to remind them that couples should n t get bogged down in little things that are not important like , say , demanding that your engagement meet a reality show s accelerated timeline . ( Okay , I m paraphrasing that last part . ) Still , Peter knows he s not ready to propose but he s also not ready to lose Rachel , either . Honestly , Peter does n t have a good answer other than he did n t really expect to fall for the Bachelorette when he signed up to be on The Bachelorette . Peter reiterates that he only wants to get engaged once in his life , etc. and he sure does n t sound convinced that he ll be able to make a decision in 24 hours . It s like , I m forcing something to happen , and you just do n t want me in that way , sighs our sad Bachelorette . I m so confused as to how you can see forever with me , but you ca n t do the step that you have to get to forever . I do n t get it . Neither do I , TBH . Peter wants to settle down and go to football games and the farmers market and wine night with painting with Rachel . Even Peter s mom said he would be comfortable having children with his partner before he d feel comfortable getting married . In short : Peter , what is your deal ? It s the same question Rachel s been asking herself all along and by the time night rolls around , she finally gets her answer . I am in love with you , Peter says . But I do n t feel that I am ready to ask you to marry me tomorrow . I do n t want to stop being with you . … Sorry , pal , but Rachel stopped listening right around tomorrow . If I agree to date you … what guarantee do I have that it s ever going to leave that stage ? she says , wiping away tears . Because my past has shown that it wo n t . Peter promises that he s going to try like , really hard to make it work , but he simply wo n t be browbeaten into proposing , even if it means losing her . In other words , he is behaving like a rational human being but there s no place for that kind of behavior on The Bachelorette . Go , Peter , go ! I m not so much annoyed at Rachel for pushing him as I am proud of Peter for pushing back against the absurdities of this show . Yes , he went on the show knowing what it was , but why do producers need to insist that everyone fall in love the same way ? Anyhow , Rachel replies with an exasperated , I ca n t answer that question , and again our favorite couple is at an impasse . And now Peter and Rachel are n t just sad they re angry at each other , and at the situation . Peter tensely suggests he will make a sacrifice and propose if she gives him a chance , simply to prove to her how important she is to him but Rachel wants a coerced proposal about as much as Peter wants to make one . Then there s no other choice ! Peter snaps . Then we just have to split , right here and now . They go around and around like this for a while longer , and continue to end up right back where they started : Rachel : If you do n t want to , do n t do it . Peter : But losing you hurts more . The Bachelorette , rightfully , worries that Peter would one day be resentful if he were essentially forced to propose on TV and Peter , rightfully , says he ca n t promise he would n t feel that way . I will give you an amazing life and an amazing relationship , Peter tells her , even if he does n t propose the next day . It s a big promise to make but not as big as the promise Bryan said he was ready to make on , like , day four . And Peter s promise is n t big enough for Rachel . I ca n t do tomorrow and you tell me you just want to be my boyfriend , she says . Oof . Does anyone else s heart hurt right now ? If you change your mind , murmurs Peter , you know where you can find me . Ever the gentleman , a sniffling Peter helps Rachel with her coat and leads her to the elevator , where they share a long , sad hug and an even sadder kiss goodbye . I love you , Rachel , whispers Peter . Take a chance , urges Peter , but Rachel is so terrified of ending up in an endless emotional holding pattern that she forces herself to say goodbye and walk away leaving both of them miserable . As if watching that breakup was n t brutal enough I cried my eyelashes off , Rachel tells us we now have to watch an emotional Peter come out and see the Bachelorette for the first time … having just watched their tear-jerking goodbye from backstage . It was incredibly difficult , says Peter of watching the scene . I m shaking like a leaf right now . Though he does n t actually think something was wrong with him or his relationship with Rachel Peter does still regret not being able to feel comfortable about proposing just to meet the show s timetable . I watched you walk out the door and I knew that you were a person I could spend the rest of my life with , he tells Rachel . And I let you go because I could n t get to that same point when I needed to . Peter does regret saying Rachel would have a mediocre life with Bryan and Rachel assures him that she s living her best life . There s clearly a lot of emotion and feeling between these two Peter feels attacked by Rachel here in the Tealight Candle Thunderdome , while Rachel says she s just frustrated with the man who was almost her fianc . I did n t feel like you knew what you wanted , says Rachel . Though she applauds him for being true to himself , she s probably still a wee bit annoyed that he signed up for The Bachelorette in the first place . I just do n t think that this world , this process , this show I just do n t think that it s for you , she says . They part with a sad hug , and then it s time for a commercial break . And when we get back from the break , Rachel is back on track though she does admit that her conversation with Peter made me question if I m rushing into this with Bryan . ( I think we can answer that for you , honey : yes . ) I just wonder if it s too much of a turnaround from last night to be in the right headspace for today . ( Again , allow us to chime in : yes . ) While Rachel just does n t know whether she s ready to accept a proposal after having her heart ripped out the night before , Bryan is champing at the bit to put this diamond monolith on the Bachelorette s finger . Given that we only have about 10 minutes left before After the Final Rose , something tells me Rachel s gon na manage to get her proposal headspace right and quick . And yes , by the time Bryan meets Rachel at the top of the ( very ) windy hilltop , she is ready to hear his ardent declaration of love how their first kiss was like a chemistry bomb going off . How she s everything he wants in a woman , a wife , the mother of my children . When it comes her turn to speak , Rachel gives Bryan what sounds like ( though was clearly not meant to be ) a somewhat backhanded compliment in the past , she s gone for the excitement of complicated relationships . But now , she s going with Bryan : Right here , in this moment , standing with you , I see my forever . So you know what happens next : Yes ! Give it to me ! demands our Bachelorette no more . ( If you listen really hard , you can hear the sound of Bryan s mom s sobs , carried all the way from Miami by the wind . ) And we re now at the Tealight Candle Thunderdome ! For whatever reason , Bryan feels the need to propose to Rachel again . ( Maybe he knows everyone was rooting for Peter ? ) Either way , the Bachelorette no more is glowing . It feels good to have him with me and by my side ! gushes Rachel . Harrison asks about the day of the proposal , and Bryan says he had blind faith that his love would be reciprocated , and it was . ( Yay ? ) As for their future , Harrison presses them for details , but Rachel insists they re not rushing anything , and they re just trying to build their lives together in a normal sense . ( Oh honey , that ship has sailed . ) For now , Rachel and Bryan say their future consists of living a normal life getting coffee , walking Copper , begging their families to accept that this is really happening , etc . So … good luck , you two . Bryan may not be the guy that I ( or a whole lot of Bachelorette viewers ) wanted Rachel to end up with , but I hope it works out for her . ( And when it does n t , I hope she finds a nice guy in the real world and lives happily ever after . ) Speaking of things that are unfortunate , the night end with an extended season preview of Bachelor in Paradise notable only because it ( partially ) reveals how the show will deal with the production shutdown : By making it part of the storyline , of course ! But that s a recap for another week . For now , rose lovers , tell me what you think of tonight s Bachelorette finale : Did Rachel make the right choice , or will she regret sending Peter packing ? Should Peter be the next Bachelor , or should it be Eric ? ( Or someone else ? ) Post your thoughts now ! And stay tuned for Chris Harrison s behind-the-scenes blog , coming tomorrow . Now , if you ll excuse me , I m going to sleep for a week . Bachelor in Paradise premieres Monday , August 14 at 8 p.m. on ABC . Read more from Yahoo TV :",

		"paragraph": "NC State coach Dave Doeren had a few gripes after his team s 38-31 home loss to Clemson over the weekend . For one , Doeren said he wished the officiating in Saturday s game was better . He was n t the only one . A bunch of NC State fans let the officials have it as they left the field at Carter-Finley Stadium . It got pretty ugly with some fans throwing objects and apparently spitting on the officials , and now university police is investigating the matter . University police issued the following statement Monday : On top of that , after speaking about the officiating , Doeren , unprompted , brought up a laptop being used on Clemson s sideline . I d like to know why there was a laptop on Clemson s sideline that people were looking at , Doeren said . I d like that to be investigated . Maybe they were n t doing anything , but I was told it s illegal to have technology on the sideline . So I d like to know that as well . According to the Raleigh News & Observer , Clemson said the laptop belonged to its social media team and was not used for coaching purposes , which would have been illegal . The laptop was removed in the second half after the ACC was made aware of its presence on the sideline . From the News & Observer : On Sunday , an ACC spokesman told the Associated Press that the league was satisfied with Clemson s explanation . The Wolfpack led 21-17 at halftime but Clemson came back and won 38-31 . NC State looked like it was poised to tie the game late in regulation after advancing to the Clemson four-yard-line on a fourth-down conversion in the final minute , but the play was called back because of a ( correct ) illegal motion penalty . As you can see below , a few NC State receivers were not set at the snap . On NC State s second fourth-down try , quarterback Ryan Finley was intercepted and Clemson subsequently held on for the win . The loss dropped NC State to 6-3 on the season and gave the Tigers a commanding lead in the ACC Atlantic Division . A win over Florida State will clinch a division title and another trip to the ACC title game for Clemson . Sam Cooper is a writer for the Yahoo Sports blogs . Have a tip ?

		"paragraph": "Warning : This post contains spoilers for Fifty Shades Freed . Laughing during sex is accepted , and even encouraged , in Fifty Shades Freed , the third and final chapter in the Fifty Shades franchise that began with the 2015 adaptation of E.L. James s bestselling trilogy . On the page , the depiction of the S&M - laced romance between the bookish Anastasia Steele and the brooding Christian Grey ( played by Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan onscreen ) was serious to a fault . In contrast , the chief pleasure of the film versions has been their pronounced comic streak , which reaches its apex in Freed . Think back to the couple s hardware store meeting early on in Fifty Shades of Grey , where they trade double-entendre-laden lines about duct tape and rope . Laughs also abound in the extended sequence where Ana carefully reviews the contract that Christian has had drawn up negotiating the exact terms , and toys , to be used in their arrangement . For example , vibrators and dildos are acceptable , but genital clamps ? Strike them from the record . And if you re in the market for a two-word example of the franchise s sense of humor , may we suggest pommel horse ? Now , some might argue that these scenes are a case study in unintentional comedy , of which there is a fair amount in all three movies . But there s also plenty of evidence in their performances , as well as off-screen remarks , that Johnson and Dornan recognize and lean into the absurdity of the series . Let s not forget that it was Dornan who personally okayed the infamous Chronicles of Riddick cameo in Fifty Shades Darker , telling a reporter at the time that he thought it would be kind of funny . And both actors go about their business in Fifty Shades Freed with barely concealed smiles as the now married Mr. and Mrs. Grey fend off the attacks of a stalker with a connection to Christian s past and wrestle with a whole new world : parenthood . At the screening Yahoo Entertainment attended this week , scattered chuckles gave way to waves of unapologetic laughter as the movie unspooled , and we have a sneaking suspicion that s precisely the response everyone involved with the film hoped for … with the likely exception of E.L. James . Here are the five funniest moments in the Fifty Shades trilogy capper . Over the course of two years and three movies , 21-year-old Steele has improbably risen from a hardware store employee to the head of a fiction imprint at a major publishing company . It s a rise that she chalks up , in part , to Christian s influence , but he insists it is due to her own eye for what sells . And apparently what sells is larger fonts ! Walking away from a huddle session , Ana directs one of her employees to increase the font size by two points on a book jacket . It s such a random direction that it feels improvised on the spot by Johnson , who clearly does n t put much stock in her alter ego s business savvy . Apparently , Paul McCartney was Christian s first love before Vin Diesel . While on a rustic getaway with his bride and her buddies , the classically trained pianist serenades them with a spectacularly cheesy rendition of the 1971 Wings anthem Maybe I m Amazed while tickling the ivories . It s a showstopper in that it literally stops the movie dead in its tracks , and Dornan milks his big musical moment for all it s worth . Kickstarter to fund a whole album in which Christian covers everything from Tiny Dancer to Look What You Made Me Do ? While piloting a souped-up luxury vehicle back to Seattle from the rustic mansion that Christian has purchased as their future home , Ana is pursued by a mystery driver in a speeding sedan . Faster than you can say family , she guns the engine and does some serious high-velocity traffic weaving that would impress even Dom Toretto . Even better is her choice of driving music , a faux-funky rock song called The Wolf , which boast howlingly hilarious lyrics like , I wan na jack it , smack it / You know the s *** that turns you on ? As the head of a multinational corporation like Grey House , one would assume that Christian has to keep a fairly busy work schedule . But the movies have never paid much attention to his business activities . ( Personally , we like to imagine that he borrows his business strategy from Unikitty . ) So when Christian s personal architect , Gia , admiringly tells him , I love what you re doing in Africa , he takes it in stride without any elaboration for Ana or us in the audience . Is he actually doing something in Africa ? Who knows ! Not Christian , that s for sure . Here s the most provocative , and funniest , thing about the Fifty Shades movies : while the books and ads tease transgressive eroticism , the films themselves present Ana and Christian as just another ordinary , slightly boring couple for whom even the boldest BDSM play inevitably becomes routine . ( This knowing normalization of S&M feels like a pointed dig at the hype surrounding the larger Fifty Shades phenomenon . ) Johnson and Dornan mostly go through the motions in Freed ‘ s copious sex scenes , with one notable exception : a late-night kitchen encounter where ice cream is their sex toy of choice rather than anything from the tricked-out Red Room . This couple has never seemed happier or more at ease than when they re spreading the dairy product on each others ‘ limbs . Fifty Shades Freed is playing in theaters now .",

		"paragraph": "Vinyl wrapped up its first season Sunday night on HBO with a spray-painted rave-up that attempted to psych out the viewing audience , to convince us that this series has the sound and vision that will leave us wanting to see next season s grand plan for the advent of late-1970s punk and disco . The tenth-episode finale was written by the show s co-creator and show-runner Terence Winter , and was his swan song , since he and HBO have parted ways . Those replacing him have a lot of mop-up work to do . Beginning to the strains of The Count Five s Psychotic Reaction and ending with the MC5 s Kick Out the Jams in other words , from a great one-hit wonder to a great cult song , neither of which would have actually helped Richie Finestra ( Bobby Cannavale ) save his record label the Vinyl episode entitled Alibi did a great job of summing up most of what s been wrong with Vinyl . It managed to extend the show s organized-crime subplot without giving us any resolution or thrills ( you knew that it was Bo Dietl s Corso who was going to bite the bullet as the only expendable character in that Goodfellas/Casino-ish execution scene ) . The episode disastrously re-positioned the show s most interesting character Ray Romano s Zak as a doofus who s lost his spirit . Oh , and Olivia Wilde s Devon , one of the few Vinyl supporting players who s always been intriguing , was nowhere to be seen at all . Instead , there was an increase in soap opera : We were supposed to believe that James Jagger s Kip would be so heartbroken that Juno Temple s Jamie would favor the other guy over him in last week s threesome that he d risk breaking up the Nasty Bits and , for good measure , overdose in abject self-pity . Vinyl prides itself on its foreshadowing of the coming trends in the ‘ 70s , and this episode ladled out irony straining to be hip : the white mail-room guy bleating that this dance music i.e. , nascent disco is the next big thing , and Richie sitting in a bar that s about to become that crud crucible of Lower East Side punk , CBGB . ( I m really not looking forward to seeing an actor try to mimic the wide-eyed starving-robot moves of David Byrne gulping out the lyrics to Talking Heads Psycho Killer next season . ) For every nice touch the recreation of the Academy of Music continued to be impeccable there was a sour note : Am I the only pair of ears that hears early-period Tom Petty , not punk , in the Bits Woman Like You ? As Vinyl went out with a final scene that found Richie making what seemed like his 18th speech about the youth-inspiring power of rock & roll , and then breaking out a case of spray-paint cans to encourage a room full of inside-the-biz revelers to wreck the offices of American Century/Alibi Records in the spirit of liberating anarchy , you had to wonder : Can this show be saved ? Is there a way for a Vinyl that s not led by Terence Winter , but which is still damp with the nostalgia felt by producers Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger , to wring itself dry , pull itself together , and become a period drama of some originality ? I truly I hope so . Because just as there was no way I was ever going to miss an episode of the first , extravagantly flawed season of Vinyl , there s also no way I ll ever miss watching what HBO and the producers try to do next season to redeem the series . I look forward to Vinyl s foray into disco : It had better do Donna Summer justice , and I want the show s new theme music to be permanently changed to the Trammps Disco Inferno . But if season two is going to use CBGB as its ground-zero , they d better start their nationwide search for someone to mimic Tom Verlaine playing guitar right now , because that means we re going to be watching television about Television .",

		"paragraph": "It s pretty universally accepted that body-shaming is n t OK , but unfortunately , people still do it and sometimes in a very public way . Gigi Hadid is the latest celebrity to speak out after being body-shamed , addressing people who claim she s gotten too skinny . In a series of tweets on Sunday , Hadid answered people who have been calling her out for her weight , citing her battle with Hashimoto s disease . Hadid is not the only celebrity who has been body-shamed while struggling with an illness . Actress Sarah Hyland wrote on Twitter in May that she has n t had the greatest year and pointed out that her weight has fluctuated in the past as a result of a kidney transplant in 2012 . However , she did n t give specifics on whether that was linked to her current health issues . I will say that this year brought a lot of changes and with that , physical changes , she continued . I am not a fan of ‘ being skinny . Which many of you have told me that I am too much of . ‘ Eat a burger , ‘ your head is bigger than your body and that s disgusting . And you re right ! I should eat a burger ! ‘ Cause they re fucking delicious ! But guess what . I do . Hyland also said that she d basically been on bed rest for the past few months , causing her to lose a lot of muscle mass . My circumstances have put me in a place where I m not in control of what my body looks like . So I strive to be as healthy as possible , as everyone should . Oh , and no , that s not Photoshop . Those are my legs . Those are my arms , she said . Hyland added that no one should aim to be the weight that I am at right now and that , while she s not thrilled with the way her body looks , it s due to her health and she ca n t please everyone . In 2015 , breast cancer survivor and E! host Giuliana Rancic told People that she was accused of having an eating disorder after a weight loss , which she attributed to a cancer-suppressing medication . It s really hurtful , she said . I m sorry that some people think I m disgustingly skinny , as they put it , but there s nothing I can do . I m lucky that I even have the type of cancer that reacts to the medicine . She added that it s hard for her to look in the mirror at times . I am really thin , Rancic said . I want to look fit and beautiful and sexy , and I ca n t . Of course , people have been body-shamed for gaining weight when they have an illness as well as for losing weight . In 2017 , actress Sasha Pieterse revealed on Dancing with the Stars that she had gained nearly 70 pounds over two years due to polycystic ovary syndrome . [ It was ] one of the hardest things I ve ever been through , she said at the time . I had no idea what was going on , and I did n t have any way of solving it . Pieterse also said it was really hurtful when people would call her fat or assume she was pregnant . They were angry . They were mad I looked like this , she said . The actress also addressed the matter on Instagram in 2015 . Clearly , body-shaming is n t OK under any circumstances , whether someone is struggling with an illness or not . But it can be pretty difficult to deal with being shamed and deal with an illness at the same time , psychologist and body image expert Sari Shepphird , PhD , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . It s hard enough to feel like anyone can relate to you when you have a serious illness , she says . You already feel like you re not yourself , and dealing with body-shaming can tear a person down tremendously . In general , body-shaming ‘ devalues people and reduces their self-worth down to their outward appearance , Tom Hildebrandt , PsyD , chief of the Division of Eating Disorders at Mount Sinai Health System , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . If you re struggling with an illness on top of that , it can make someone feel worse about themselves at a time when they may already be having difficulty with body changes they re going through , he says and that can lead to low self-esteem , depression , and problems with eating . If you re body-shamed , Hildebrandt recommends treating the comments like a racial slur that is , something that s incredibly offensive and wrong . For some reason , body-shaming is seen as somehow more acceptable than other forms of bullying , and it s important to show people that it s actually not . People should be held accountable , he says . There s no context where body-shaming is useful or healthy . If your body has changed due to an illness , you can mention that in your response to try to enlighten your critic , or not it s ultimately up to you , Jennifer Carter , PhD , a sports psychologist who specializes in eating disorders at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . However , some people use it as a teaching moment to educate people about their illness , which can have a profound effect on shamers and even get some to apologize , she says . But again , your response ( or lack thereof ) is your choice . You have the right to your own body and to do what you please , Shepphird says .

		"paragraph": "Spoiler alert ! If you have n t watched this week s episode of Justified Collateral , written by Chris Provenzano and VJ Boyd and directed by Michael Pressman stop reading now . As he ll do throughout the season , showrunner Graham Yost takes us inside the writers room to break down key scenes and tease what s next . The series penultimate episode found Boyd putting two bullets into Constable Bob ( Patton Oswalt ) and surviving Zachariah s explosive suicide , Raylan and Boyd running into each other instead of Ava on the mountain , Ava being captured by the cops in Markham s pocket , Markham partnering with Loretta , and Vasquez issuing a BOLO for Raylan ( who was nabbed himself taking Bob to the hospital ) . Let s start with Boyd s final conversation with Hagan ( Shea Whigham ) in the truck . It feels like we ve been building to that talk all series : Boyd is like Harlan s Billy the Kid , and we all love a good outlaw story but the cold , hard truth is that sometimes outlaws do n t give a s t about you and may shoot you in the head . Is that how you view that moment?Yeah . That was part of the thinking behind it . Walton struggled mightily with this storyline and with that scene , but when we told him that we d cast Shea Whigham , he kind of melted and said , OK . Now it s going to work . He just loves Shea , and they ve known each other , I m sure , for years . Shea just brought a truth and a weight and a reality to it that just meshed well with where Boyd was and is . So it was a tough one . I think the way Pressman shot it was beautiful . Related : ‘ Justified Postmortem : Graham Yost Breaks Down that Epic Brawl in ' Fugitive Number One Do you think that s a moment where some fans could turn on Boyd , watching him kill a seemingly innocent man who s not involved at all in this world ? Whether or not the audience will turn on Boyd is a question . I think that this has just been part of the reality of Boyd for a long , long time . You know , there is that circular intent for the season , to bring things back to the way Boyd and Ava and Raylan to a degree originally were and restate that question . Heading into the final episode , there is a real question whether or not Raylan will kill Boyd , and he certainly has good reason to . Moving on to the Raylan-Boyd shootout in the woods , did you set it at night just so Raylan could have that awesome line about knowing it was Boyd because his teeth glow in the dark ? [ Laughs . ] You know , the history of that scene is funny . As we were breaking the episode , we realized Raylan s going to be coming down the mountain looking for Ava while Boyd is going up the mountain looking for Ava . We first thought , We ca n t really have a scene between them , can we ? Why do n t we just have them pass close by ? Then we realized we re missing a huge opportunity . Chris Provenzano really pushed for a big scene . We kidded him a lot , because I think the first draft of that sequence was eight pages long and included so many runs and jumps and just missing each other . Michael Pressman said , Chris , you get one near miss . Then the dialogue was hacked down to a degree , but it was still a lengthy scene . Leonard Chang , one of the writers , came up with this idea from Aristotle I believe it was in Poetics which is a scene of anagnorisis . It s also something that Shakespeare used in the tragedies where the hero , the villain , whoever usually the tragic hero has a moment of clarity , of realization of who they are and what s going on and what their flaw is . The scene is kind of that . It kind of morphed a little bit away from it , but in our short form in the room , we always called it the anagnorisis scene . We really wanted to go to the heart of Raylan s drive to kill Boyd , and Boyd pushing his buttons on that . So the acknowledgment that maybe Raylan ca n t get Boyd without becoming Boyd.Yes . Raylan s line , I crossed the line with my eyes wide open , is that he s perfectly aware of who he is and what he s doing . The teeth glow in the dark line was something that we d pitched almost as a joke in the room . It was sort of like , How does Raylan see Boyd ? And someone said , His teeth glow in the dark . Chris ended up using it , and it s a great line . At what point did you decide you needed to bring Bob back into the mix ? Did you need to give Raylan an out of that scene ? Fans would n t have been happy if he did n t go help him . That was partly it . We also just loved the idea of Bob stumbling into this whole thing and becoming collateral in a way of Raylan s adventures , or misadventures , as it were . Are you ready for trivia of trivia ? Related : ' Justified Director Jon Avnet Shares His Detailed Shot List for That Winnebago Battle Always.When you hear Bob yelling Help ! , did it sound like Bob ? It was distant , mixed down , and all sorts of effects on it and stuff , but we did n t have Patton doing that . We were doing the final playback of the episode where we go through all the sound and say , Bring up this helicopter sound , or Take it down , or Add this line , or Take it out , and we did n t have anything that worked . So that s me . That s me yelling , Help ! They set up a microphone on the mixing stage . I backed away from the mic and did a few takes . That is my one big moment of performance on this series , me yelling Help ! as Constable Bob . I love that . Was it always the idea to have Boyd shoot Bob off-screen then ? Because I think , again , that would have been tough for fans to watch.I mean , we talked about showing it , but the smart idea there was to stay with Ava , because Ava is the client of the show for the last three episodes , really . You re worried about what s going to happen to her . Are the bad guys going to get her ? So the idea of her knowing that it s Boyd , and Bob going to investigate , and her saying , No , Bob . Do n t go , and then hearing that [ while she s ] zip-tied to a handhold in the crappy Gremlin , and is she going to get free ? Thank God it s an old Gremlin and she can tear herself free . But just the idea of playing that terror off of her was a really strong choice . Anything else you can say about the Ava and Bob scene ? The whole idea of him trying to soothe her by saying there s an air freshener in the car that smells like a mocha latte … [ Laughs . ] I ca n t remember if that was scripted or if that was Patton . He has come up with some of the great lines for Bob . I mean , Stay frosty was his , back in Season 4 . Beef stew , when he did the whole thing about pulling his knife and stabbing someone . But there is a moment in there that just sort of , to me , exemplifies the greatness that is Patton Oswalt , which is this very , very funny line where he accuses Ava of trying to bribe him and all of that , and he says , And do n t try to seduce me . It s been tried . When we read that line , we laughed . It s very funny in the show , but the thing is that the laugh is truer and better because he just plays it straight . We saw Ava call someone when she was on the run.You re not supposed to know who she s calling . That s something we will find out in the finale ? Yes . To a degree . It will always remain somewhat of a mystery , but I think the audience will understand what happened . And when Markham s dirty cops caught her , Ava dropped Dewey s necklace out of her back pocket . So that will come back into play as well?Yes . Related : ' Justified Postmortem : Mary Steenburgen Talks About That RV Scene and the Katherine/Avery Love Story I also wanted to talk about that scene with Gutterson relaying Vasquez issuing a BOLO on Raylan to Art over the phone . It was kind of like the marshal version of a live tweet so funny . But Raylan getting caught at the end of the episode seems to suggest that we ll see more of Gutterson , Art , and Rachel in the finale . A certain amount . Certainly a lot of Art . Gutterson and Rachel , but sort of in a different context . And that s all I ll say . [ That scene ] was just fun . It was just something that evolved in terms of how incensed and how riled up Rick Gomez got playing Vasquez . I will say this , that s his last scene in the series . We all talked about it , that it was bringing it back around to how Vasquez was about Raylan at the beginning . He s just so furious , and Gutterson is just so cool and kind of funny about it . It s just the joy of working with Jacob [ Pitts ] , frankly . It s also Mel Fair as Nelson : You having a bad day , David ? It s one of his nicest moments in the series . Vasquez also has that scene with Wynn , when we get the nice tennis callback for Duffy with the Billie Jean King memorabilia being among his returned personal possessions . The big thing in that scene was we wanted to get to that moment where Vasquez asks him straight out , Who killed my boss ? We know that Duffy arranged it . Duffy just says , I honestly , truly do n t know . We knew that there would be a variety of things in the box . Now , you ca n t apparently say that something is a Billie Jean King autographed tennis ball unless you actually get an autographed Billie Jean King tennis ball with a certificate . You ca n t just fake that on a show , apparently . I did n t know that . So John Harrington , our head of props , sent away and got a Billie Jean King tennis ball and a certificate . That was real . Then as you see in the bus stop scene later , that tube of prescription toothpaste serves a purpose , as does the Eagle Scout knife . So we were planting those two things , but the Billie Jean King tennis ball was just kind of a fun bit . Related : ' Justified Star Joelle Carter Talks About Ava s Gunplay and Getaway , and Making Elmore Leonard Proud The whole idea of Wynn wanting a dog grooming van as his next mode of transportation is just perfect.Yeah , and there will be a payoff of that . Zachariah decided to wait at Grubes s place for Boyd and try to kill him . Was that the fate you always had in mind for Zachariah?He tried to blow up Boyd once before and that did n t work , and he tries again and sadly for his sake , it does n t work . I will tease that the presence of dynamite in that part of the story was important to us . The idea of him blowing himself up , we thought , was pretty cool . But the big thing was that in the manner of our series where we think we re going to kill someone off and then say , Wait a second , let s just keep him around . We might be able to use him we thought of Zachariah dying in [ Episode ] 9 when he tries to blow up Boyd . Then we saw that there could be something else pretty cool for him , and there is an echo of Zachariah in the final episode . That s all I ll say about that . Loretta had some great scenes in this episode . RIP , Derek ( Riley Bodenstab ) . We just liked the idea of Loretta s in a jam , she s hiding out , she s bought the Bennett property so she s got all their drying sheds and homes and all of that . Hiding out in that old drying shed was a cool place to have her be . We liked the idea of bringing in Derek , who had been her quasi boyfriend back in Season 5 . He makes the mistake of taking the job , because he goes up against Boone and Jenny . That conversation between Markham and Loretta I love how close they were sitting and that Kaitlyn Dever totally holds her own up against Sam Elliott . What did you want to accomplish with that moment?Without teasing or spoiling anything in the final episode , we were breaking the two of them kind of together at the same time , to a degree , so we would go back and forth of where we needed Loretta to be in the final episode and therefore where we d have her in the 12th . Really , the crux of it was Markham saying , I see some of Katherine in you , and even more than that , some of Mags in you . There she is , she could be killed , and she talks her way out of it , and we just thought that was a great thing for Loretta to be able to do . If felt like you needed that earlier scene of Markham talking to Katherine s body , to explain that he wanted to kill Duffy but he was going after the money first.Yes . You hear it so many times everyone always says , Where is the goddamn money ? I ve got to get the goddamn money that that s what the money is called . It s the goddamn money . You know , that s unintentional , but I think there is something to it , which is that the money , to a degree , is cursed . That money has been damned . All of the trouble that has unfolded over this entire season is people s quest to get or defend that money . That scene in the morgue , first of all , thanks so much to Mary [ Steenburgen ] for coming back to spend a few hours lying there on the stage to do that scene . In the gag reel , they do have her waking up and looking at the camera going , Wait , there s money ? It was just Pressman directing and Sam performing it it s really a wonderful scene . Related : ' Justified Postmortem : Graham Yost Breaks Down the Shocking Ending of ' Trust One of the sad things about this episode is our great composer , Steve Porcaro , his brother passed away while we were in post on this episode . He had had a long , long struggle with ALS , so Steve could n t do the music for this episode . Mark Bonilla wrote most of the music for this episode . Mark wrote the cue for that morgue scene . It was just a beautiful piece of work . One of the interesting things about this episode was how much work we ended up doing in [ post ] . It s a mad , headlong rush at that point [ in the season ] to write the scripts and get them shot . You wish that we d been able to plan and plan and get stuff written far ahead , and it s the end of the series , and let s have everything nailed down . It s like nope , this is a television series and we are running for the finish line . There was a great deal of work we did in post structurally , moving scenes around , and that [ morgue ] scene was a scene that could move . It was originally supposed to be before the credits and the teaser , and we moved it later because we wanted to get things really moving for Raylan by the end of the teaser , having him leave Cope and head up into the hills . Raylan signing over Arlo s home to Cope ( Tom E. Proctor ) and the hill people seemed like him making his intent clear : He s leaving Kentucky . He wants to be gone . We talked about Raylan encountering Cope and the hill people one more time in the series . This sort of came to us , that this could be an obstacle for him trying to get up the mountain . It was the notion that times have even changed for the hill people , that they ca n t just stay up where they ve been for generations , that they re going to have to move , that things have shifted . Then the idea going back to the sort of origin story of Arlo , and Bo , and Drew Thompson , and the drugs that came down from the sky and all of that that Arlo had been instrumental , and it sort of started his empire , as it were . That it came back to the hill people , which related to Raylan s mother , Frances . We just liked the circularity of that . The notion of him signing over the property really landed well with all of us . Also , Raylan states that was one of his many excuses for not leaving , and now he s just giving it up .

Then , to add insult to injury , Mary resolves things with Henry and they get hitched in a quickie wedding , while Edith gets dumped by Bertie . Poor , poor Lady Edith . There s one more episode left , the Christmas special ( airing March 6 ) will this Cinderella get her happy ending then ? And will her wicked sister make up for what she did ? Here s what went down this week at the Abbey : Mary and Henry Mary is moping about her breakup , and Tom pushes her to call Henry . He s the one for you , trust me , and give him a chance , he says , but she shrugs him off . People like us ( meaning herself and her titled family , not Tom and certainly not Henry ) have to be careful about who they marry , especially if they re inheriting a fortune . Henry happens to drop by the Abbey after doing some car things in Durham ( which , as Lord Grantham points out , probably are non-existent ) . His visit is highly annoying to Mary , and things just get worse when Henry asks her if money is the only reason she s fighting their relationship . Now , she s even angrier that he s calling her a snob , and storms off . When he leaves without saying goodbye the next morning , and seeing how happy Edith and Bertie look ( more on that below ) , Mary decides to use the sharpest weapon in her arsenal . I admire you , Bertie , she says . Not everyone would accept Edith s past . Oh snap ! Edith is forced to admit to the truth , and Tom yells at Mary for ruining not just her own life , but her sisters . How many lives are you going to wreck just to smother your own misery ? he asks . You re a coward like all bullies , you re a coward . The Dowager Countess is called in to prevent any more wreckage from occurring thanks to Hurricane Mary , and finally Mary confesses what s really holding her back : She can not be a crash widow for a second time . But the Dowager says something very surprising : She believes in rules and traditions , but also , I believe in love . So , Mary stops fighting this feeling . She goes to Matthew s grave to ask for his heavenly blessing , then summons Henry back to Downton . He comes , with a marriage license ( ! ) , and they get hitched the following day . What is this , Las Vegas ? A new couple in a new world , Robert says . Remember when Downton Abbey premiered and Lady Mary looked down her nose at cousin Matthew for being a country lawyer ? Well , this is certainly a new Mary now . Maybe she will even be nicer to Edith . Nah . Edith and Bertie When Bertie talked about his more arty than sporty cousin Lord Hexham , we guessed one of two outcomes : 1 ) His Lordship would come back to England and hook up with Thomas , or 2 ) Bertie would inherit his cousin s title and Edith would be a marchioness . Well , option 2 sort of happened . Lord Hexham dies in Tangiers , and Bertie is his heir ! Golly gumdrops ! a gleeful Robert declares . But Edith is not quite so thrilled she still has n t accepted his proposal or told him about Marigold . Bertie comes to Downton before flying to Tangiers , and presses her for an answer . She seems to be trying to work up the nerve to tell him the truth , but then he talks about being a king of the county and always on parade and his very stern mother . When Edith tells him she loves him , he takes that as a yes , and tells the news to the family the next day at breakfast . That s when Mary goes nuclear on Edith . Bertie asks why Edith did n t tell him about Marigold at the start , and she admits that she thought it would ruin everything . He ca n t marry someone who does n t trust him and who he ca n t trust . Her life was about to be perfectly wonderful , and now it s all slipping away . After they wish each other luck , Bertie leaves . A tearful Edith packs up to leave for London , but not before she and Mary have the row we all knew was coming . Edith calls her a nasty , jealous , scheming bitch . You re a bitch , and not content with ruining your own life , you re determined to ruin mine ! But surprise , surprise , when Mary gets married , Edith shows up in time to attend the wedding . Mary apologizes and Edith explains that she came because they re still sisters . And someday , only they will remember Sybil , their mother and father , their grandmother , Matthew , and Michael Gregson . Our shared memories will mean more than our mutual dislike . Poor Edith . At least she still has little Marigold . Miss Baxter and Mr. MolesleyMr . Molesley begins his stint as a teacher ( part-time as he still works at the Abbey ) , and he s pretty nervous , especially after his first class does n t go well . The students are bored , and he might be expecting too much out of them . But after a pep talk by Miss Baxter , he goes back and reveals that he s been in service for most of his life . The students have parents who are servants , too , and they re awed at the idea that education can give them a leg up on life . Mr. Molesley oh captain , my captain ! Isobel and Lord MertonLord Merton clearly hopes that Isobel will change her mind about marrying him now that the oh-so-friendly Miss Cruikshank is in the picture . But Isobel has tea with the cool little miss , and informs her that she wo n t wed Lord Merton until Larry Grey himself apologizes to her . As the Dowager points out , The ball is in Larry s court only he can play it . Mr. Carson and Mrs. Hughes He s in full Butler of Downton Abbey mode this week , disapproving of Mrs. Patmore s scandal and the Granthams helping her out . But he does n t have to worry that his wife has gone off him . You re my curmudgeon , she says with a kiss on the cheek . Anna and Mr. BatesShe s still pregnant , there is a God . As for the singletons : Poor Thomas moment : Sigh . Poor Thomas episode , more like . Or Poor Thomas s whole life . Look , has he been mean , nasty , scheming , and downright evil in the past ? Yes . He s also a gay man in a world a long way away from accepting him . He s lonely and he s getting pushed out of the one place he s been able to call home . No wonder he slits his wrists . At least Miss Baxter and Andy manage to find him in time . So , maybe he does have some friends after all . Dowager Countess quip of the week : A good butler should not need to be told . Violet , indignant that Spratt did not anticipate her surprise arrival . Downton Abbey airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on Masterpiece on PBS .",

		"paragraph": "Michael Cohen , President Donald Trump 's former lawyer , is under investigation for bank and tax fraud , and investigators are looking at more than $ 20 million in loans to a taxi company he owns with his family , The New York Times reported on Sunday . The value of those scrutinized loans had not been previously reported . The report , which cited multiple sources familiar with the matter , said authorities are additionally looking into whether the former fixer broke any laws by arranging financial deals with women claiming to have had affairs with Trump . The Times said two of its sources indicated that prosecutors could file charges by the end of August . Lanny Davis , a lawyer for Cohen , did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment about the report from the Times . The newspaper said Cohen and his lawyers declined to comment for its article . The bank fraud portion of the investigation centers on whether Cohen misrepresented the value of his holdings in order to secure loans from two New York lenders , Sterling National Bank and the Melrose Credit Union , the report said . The Times added that there 's no indication Cohen missed payments or caused losses to either financial institution , which , according to the paper , is usually part of a bank fraud charge . Politics watchers are tracking Cohen 's case because he could potentially reach an agreement with prosecutors that would offer him leniency in exchange for his cooperating with Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller 's probe into whether the Trump campaign was involved with Russian attempts to skew the 2016 U.S. presidential race .

		"paragraph": "From ELLE Serena Williams called it her Black Panther suit . Custom designed with Nike to prevent blood clots-the health condition that nearly killed Williams after she gave birth to her daughter-Williams said the full-length black catsuit made her feel like a superhero . The French Tennis Federation called it disrespectful . In an interview with Tennis Magazine last week , FTF president Bernard Giudicelli announced they will be changing the French Open s dress code going forward . Serena s outfit this year , for example , would no longer be accepted , he said . One must respect the game and the place . Williams , for her part , seems unbothered . Responding to the comments on Saturday , Williams said she has a good relationship with Giudicelli and is confident they would come to an understanding . If they know that some things are for health reasons , then there s no way they would n t be okay with it , she said . At the U.S. Open last night , Williams was in dominant form-and back in stand-out style . For first-round win over Poland 's Magda Linette , she wore a black , one-sleeve tutu designed by Virgil Abloh . Williams 's singular on-court style often feels like a metaphor for all the other ways she is singular : the world 's best player and the black star of an overwhelmingly white , historically exclusionary sport . So to fans and observers , the catsuit ban was the latest instance of Williams facing racial discrimination within a sport she has single-handedly propelled forward . From racist slurs at Indian Wells to disproportionate drug testing to comments comparing her to an animal or a man , the sport continually sends the message that Williams does n t belong . Her strong black body-now uncovered by a skirt-seems to be perceived as a threat to tennis status quo . The FTF s updated dress code reflects a troubling desire to uphold ideas about respectability and femininity-white femininity , specifically-in women s sports , a tradition that dates back more than a century in the US . In the beginning of the twentieth century , women s participation in sports was dictated by the skirt theory : the only sports acceptable for women were ones they could play without wearing pants . The 1914 Olympic Committee opposed women taking part in any event in which they could not wear long skirts . Sports like golf , archery , and croquet were most popular , but women managed to play baseball in full-length skirts , as well as ice skate . In the 1870s , then women s college Vassar 's baseball team , the Resolutes played the game in the era 's cumbersome fashion . As long as women continued to play in skirts , the thinking went , white men did n t need to fear white women had abandoned their feminine duties to live like men . We see remnants of this thinking today : just last year , Toronto Blue Jays manager John Gibbons responded to what he perceived as a softening of baseball rules by saying that his team might as well come out wearing dresses next game . His commentary ties into patriarchal ideas about femininity and weakness , yes , but also the notion that anyone who plays in skirts could not also be considered a serious athlete . Women took it upon themselves to shorten their skirts , giving them the freedom of movement to compete at higher levels . In the 1920s , Norwegian figure skater Sonja Henie scandalized the skating community when she shortened her skirt to her knees , allowing her to spin and jump like the male skaters did . When the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League came around in 1943 , women were again required to wear skirts to play baseball - though they were much shorter now . Still , the skirts were not ideal for sliding , a problem made famous by the film A League of Their Own . But the short skirt or skort became entrenched as the female uniform for sports-in spite of the obvious impracticality . Until recently , even female boxers were asked to wear skirts . Today , dress codes for many women s sports are being policed by two seemingly opposed forces - modesty and objectification . Either cover up your body because it s inappropriate or a distraction , or reveal almost all of it because female athletes are primarily here for men s pleasure . Ever since women s sports began to be televised ( though , it should be noted , still at a rate far less than men s sports ) , the age-old demand for female modesty was met with a new demand to draw in audiences . Forced sexiness is no less sexist than forced modesty . In sports like track and field , gymnastics and volleyball , skimpy uniforms can prevent players who dress modestly , like Muslim athletes , from participating . It was 2004 before the International Skating Union did away with the rule that ladies must wear skirts and in 2012 , the International Volleyball Federation finally stopped requiring that female volleyball players wear bikinis , which many people saw as a sexist rule . Meanwhile , women in culturally conservative sports like tennis and golf must try to walk the line between attracting audiences and distracting them . These dress codes are not so different than the controversial school dress codes in place for girls . They use arbitrary moral standards to control women s bodies and expression-privileging onlookers opinions over those of the women wearing the clothes . Last year , the LPGA released a new dress code that has been criticized as slut-shaming . It includes guidelines like Length of skirt , skort , and shorts MUST be long enough to not see your bottom area … at any time , standing or bent over and plunging necklines are NOT allowed . Rarely , in discussing women s dress codes , do we discuss what s distracting for the athletes . When it comes to sports , safety and function need to come into play when choosing uniforms . But all too often morals and prejudice are the deciding factors . Williams was not the first female tennis player to attempt to buck tradition with a bodysuit . In 1985 , Anne White wore a white , full-length version to Wimbledon . Her opponent complained , she was not allowed to wear it again the next day , and news coverage was dominated by stories about her clothing . The chairman of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club , released a statement that said , in part , \" The rules state that clothes must be predominantly white and constitute ' normal tennis attire . ' Anne 's outfit was certainly all white but could hardly be called normal tennis attire . Calling Williams s catsuit disrespectful harkens back to racist and sexist ideas about what female athletes should be : white , feminine , and unserious . When athletes do n t conform to the these ideals that still dominate the sports landscape , they are criticized or , as in Williams s case , accused of not honoring the culture of the game . But Williams s influence , her outspokenness , and her on-court performances are the biggest selling points the sport of tennis has . Tennis has Williams - considered by many to be the greatest athlete ever - to thank for all the headlines generated by per talent and her personality . By banning her catsuit , the powers that be sent the message that upholding the status quo matters more than respecting their star athlete . By winning 6-4 , 6-0 in a headline-making tutu-black-designed , over-the-top feminine , and dead serious-Williams reminded us why she 's still the star . ( ' You Might Also Like ' , )",

		"paragraph": "Canadian marijuana Goliath Aurora Cannabis ( NYSE : ACB ) filed to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) earlier this month , and yesterday its shares began trading on the exchange under its new symbol , ACB . The move to the NYSE opens the door for investors who previously avoided buying because they did n't want to buy -- or were prohibited from buying ! -- Aurora Cannabis shares in the over-the-counter market or on the Toronto Stock Exchange . Here 's why the company 's move to the NYSE is important and what you should know about this cannabis company before investing in it . IMAGE SOURCE : GETTY IMAGES . Most of the $ 150 billion that changes hands every year in the marijuana market occurs on the illicit black market , but increasingly , legalization is bringing these transactions out of the shadows and onto regulated marketplaces . In the U.S. , 30 states have passed laws allowing medical marijuana 's use , and nine states , including California , have passed laws establishing recreational marketplaces . But despite growing momentum in the U.S. , marijuana remains illegal on a federal level , and that 's unlikely to change anytime soon . The story 's different in Canada . A nationwide medical marijuana market has been thriving since rule changes in 2014 cleared the way to regulating growers and retailers , and this month Canada became the first of the G7 countries to legalize marijuana 's recreational use nationwide . Although it remains to be seen how large Canada 's marijuana market will be , estimates suggest that the biggest cannabis companies in Canada could be about to profit from billions of dollars in additional sales . According to Statista , medical marijuana sales in Canada were roughly 600 million Canadian dollars in 2017 , and according to Deloitte , recreational marijuana sales in Canada next year could eclipse CA$ 4 billion . Investors interested in marijuana stocks have been hamstrung because marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance in the U.S . The scheduling limits access to banking services and prevents companies from conducting business across state lines . As a result , the U.S. market is highly fragmented , and most U.S. marijuana companies trade on the over-the-counter market , a thinly regulated market that has exposed investors to fraud in the past . Instead of risking it on over-the-counter stocks , investors have been forced to look north of the border to Canada , where companies like Aurora Cannabis trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange . Buying and selling stocks outside the U.S. , however , can be more expensive than trading stocks on the U.S. market , and many professional investors , including mutual funds , are governed by mandates that prevent them from owning companies that trade on foreign exchanges . The inability for Canadian cannabis companies to tap these U.S. investors for funding was n't a major problem in the past . However , it 's become more important because the recreational market opportunity is more capital-intensive than the medical marijuana market opportunity . In order to satisfy demand caused by a shift to a regulated market from the black market , cannabis companies are investing significantly to boost marijuana production capacity , develop distribution , and establish a brick-and-mortar and an online retail presence . These projects have required Aurora Cannabis to issue more shares to raise money to orchestrate M&A deals . It 's also reportedly prompted conversations with large , established consumer products companies , including Coca-Cola , about deals that could provide it with expertise and money . Now that Aurora Cannabis is trading on the NYSE , the company should have an even greater ability to raise money from stock offerings . It may also make it easier to negotiate with U.S. consumer products companies that may have worried in the past that a deal could jeopardize their own U.S. listing . IMAGE SOURCE : GETTY IMAGES . Aurora Cannabis does n't appear willing to enter the U.S. market until marijuana prohibition ends federally , so its listing on the NYSE still does n't give U.S. investors exposure to markets in individual states , such as California , that have passed pro-pot laws . Nevertheless , there 's plenty of opportunity for growth in Canada and elsewhere , including Germany . The Canadian recreational market is limited to dried flower and cannabis oils for now , but edibles , vapes , and certain concentrates could become available there as early as next year . Those products are expected to drive significant interest among new users , thus expanding the addressable market . As more products become available , beer , wine , and spirits giant Constellation Brands predicts Canada 's retail marijuana market could be worth $ 11 billion in 15 years . If so , then Aurora Cannabis could be perfectly positioned . Its acquisition of MedReleaf earlier this year gives it CA$ 33 million in trailing pro forma revenue , making it the top-selling Canadian cannabis company . The company 's acquisitions also expanded it even more beyond dried flower to extracts , which command better profit margins . Meeting Canada 's demand will require increasingly more state-of-the-art production space , and Aurora Cannabis is arguably the leader there , too . It 's investing CA$ 150 million in next-generation greenhouses , and spending on its \" Sky \" class facilities is expected to increase its production capacity to 570,000 kilograms , up from about 108,000 kilograms of funded capacity one year ago . Its new production facilities are already starting to improve gross margin because automation is reducing labor costs , which are the biggest expense that 's associated with operating greenhouses . Last quarter , Aurora Cannabis ' gross margin improved 7 % to 74 % , and over time Aurora Cannabis is targeting production costs at its Sky class facilities below $ 1 per gram . If it hits that target , it 'll be one of the lowest-cost producers in Canada . Having said that , valuing this company is n't easy . It 's still losing money on an operational basis and there 's no telling when that will stop . Therefore , it 's essentially useless to compare its price-to-earnings ratio to other major participants , most of whom are also losing money because of their spending on expansion projects . Other valuation metrics , including price-to-sales ratios and price-to-book ratios , are n't much use , either . Price-to-sales ratios are based on trailing revenue that does n't reflect the expected jump in sales next year because of legalization . Similarly , price-to-book ratios , which show how much investors are paying for each dollar of a company 's breakup value , may fail to appreciate how much these companies could be worth in the future because of widespread legalization . Personally , I think its addressable market is big enough to justify its current market cap , but it could be years before this company matures . Therefore , only aggressive investors who can withstand the fits and starts likely to occur in this industry over the next decade should consider buying Aurora Cannabis .

After 108 years of hope , the Cubs finally made it to the White House to celebrate the team s World Series title . President Obama , who has not been secretive about his Chicago White Sox fandom during his presidency , admitted he enjoyed the Cubs run . Upon hearing this , the Cubs Twitter account had a little fun with that quote : Cubs President Theo Epstein even got in on the act , offering President Obama a midnight pardon for his White Sox fandom . With the President s rooting interests out of the way , the two sides managed to have a lovely ceremony . As a gift for inviting the club to the White House , the Cubs gave the President a number items , including a lifetime pass to Wrigley Field for his entire family . The 44th President of the United States also received a custom jersey from the Cubs own No. 44 , Anthony Rizzo . President Obama was also presented with some custom Jordans , courtesy of Dexter Fowler . Speaking of clothes , we would be remiss if we did n t mention some of the Cubs outfits for the event . Of all the combinations , Rizzo s red suit was a clear standout . Recently-retired Cubs catcher David Ross was also in attendance , and the President took the opportunity to note the similarities between he and the World Series winner . In Ross defense , his retirement party has come to an end . While his playing career is done , he will stick with the Cubs as a special assistant to baseball operations . With the Cubs last-minute visit to D.C. , Obama has hosted nine Major League Baseball teams at the White House during his presidency .

		"paragraph": "Thirty-five years ago , on July 27 , 1983 , a woman named Madonna Louise Ciccone released her self-titled debut album , and it soon launched not just a music revolution , but a fashion revolution as well . The disc s stark black-and-white artwork Madonna clasping her unforgettable face between bracelet-stacked hands on the front , wrapping a thick dog-chain necklace around her throat on the back comprised some of the most striking pop imagery of the 80s . It was n t long before every little girl in the world wanted to be Madonna ( or a Madonnabe ) , bedecking themselves with oversized lace hair bows , crucifixes , stacks of rubber bangles , and , much to their parents chagrin , Boy Toy belts and visible bras . But Madonna did n t come up with her early signature look entirely on her own . She had a lucky star on her side back then , a visionary stylist , who helped craft that image . And that woman also went by a singular name : Maripol . Without Maripol a French-expat artist , jewelry designer , photographer , film producer , and NYC girl-about - ( down ) town Madonna may never have become MADONNA . After all , Maripol was the woman who introduced street-style jelly bracelets to the mainstream ( fun fact : Grace Jones was the first pop singer to wear Maripol s rubber creations , on her ankles ) , and she was the woman who first convinced Madonna to dance onstage in a bra . Speaking to Yahoo Entertainment from New York , Maripol humbly , grudgingly concedes , Whatever , yes I did create a legend . Recalling the night that started it all , at New York hip-hop club the Roxy almost four decades ago , she says , There was a lot of mix of culture coming from England , with people like Bow Wow Wow , and then there was Fab Five Freddy , from Yo ! MTV Raps , which was also the beginning of this whole movement . Fab Five Freddy asked me if I could find cute girls , and I turned around and saw Madonna and asked her if she would want to go onstage . I asked her if she had a nice bra on , and she thought I was out of my mind ! I asked her to actually take her top off . And the rest is history . So , was that the unofficial beginning of the underwear-as-outerwear trend ? No , that was the beginning of the fact that I m French ! I was less puritan than anyone else , and I was always taking my clothes off , unfortunately , Maripol laughs . After that , Madonna actually made an appointment to come see me in my loft , because she wanted me to create her look . … I had already invented the rubber bracelet , and I was the art director of Fiorucci , and I thought that she was the perfect person to carry around my style . And it was perfect for her as well . Maripol and Madonna s first fashion collaboration was for the Madonna album cover , on which Maripol s bold , punky jewelry was practically as much the star as Madonna herself . Maripol s involvement in Madonna s early career opened many doors for the singer . For instance , there was the night that Madonna , at the time still a total unknown , performed at Fiorucci s 15th anniversary soiree a booking that Maripol , the art director for the trendsetting Italian boutique in the late 70s and early 80s , had to fight for . I had a big budget , and I kept saying to my boss , ‘ I want this singer . Everybody was like , ‘ No , no , who is that , who is Madonna ? We want the girl who played in Flashdance , Jennifer Beals . And I m like , ‘ Jennifer Beals ? She is not a singer ! Finally , I won . I had a big rubber cake with 15 candles and Madonna to jump out of it , and Madonna jumped out that day . The club was packed , and she got the manager of Michael Jackson [ Ron Weisner ] to come , and I think he signed her right there on the spot . Maripol maintained a massive influence on Madonna s style during the subsequent Like a Virgin era , more than once stopping her star client and friend from becoming a fashion victim . Recalling the cover shoot for the breakthrough sophomore album , Maripol says : The art director had this idea , which was to have the black Sabbath-type virgin . You know , like black lipstick , black this , black that . And I kept saying to her , ‘ We should go for the real thing , come on ! ' Eventually Madonna wore her VMAs-immortalized white wedding dress ( more on that in a bit ) , and the result was yet another iconic album cover . Maripol also stepped in when she thought the stage costumes for 1984 s Virgin Tour were , well , a little too Prince-ly . There was a designer , a really nice English girl , Marlene Stewart . And Marlene designed everything [ for the tour ] very Purple Rain . And I went to Madonna and she showed me everything and I said , ‘ Madonna , you re Madonna . Why do n t you keep a bit of what you have ? And she listened to me . Madonna s peekaboo bridal gown still stands as one of her most memorable looks , of course . Older generations may vividly recall the exact moment when they first saw Elvis twitch his pelvis on TV or when the Beatles first performed on Ed Sullivan , but for children of the 80s , the defining televised music moment was when Madonna kicked off the first annual MTV Video Music Awards in 1984 . No one had ever seen anything like it at the time , and Maripol was there to see it in person . At first , it seemed like the racy performance might be career suicide for Madonna , Maripol recalls . I was right there , I saw it happening . I saw what [ MTV ] did , and I can tell you that they tried to destroy her that day . They went under her skirt with the camera they were trying to intimidate her . But of course , the stunt instead stratospherically catapulted Madonna to superstar status . Madonna had to break through I knew she was going to make it big , because I could see how ambitious she was , in a very genuine and sweet way . The wedding outfit did help . I knew that day that she had made it , says Maripol . Every journalist was rushing , running , going , ‘ Oh my God , who is this girl with the white outfit rolling and crawling on the floor , with crosses in her ears and her name is Madonna ? And she s singing about being like a virgin ? They were shocked , yes . Once the aforementioned Madonnabes came out in full force and took over malls everywhere , Maripol had mixed feelings about the trends she d helped create . One time , when judging a Madonna lookalike contest in 1985 with none other than Andy Warhol at Macy s ( amusingly , the department store that would carry Madonna s own Material Girl fashion line decades later ) , Maripol was conflicted . I saw those young girls , and it was sad . They wanted to mimic Madonna , and they were so young . It was all about the fun and stuff but … oh my God , she sighs . Perhaps Maripol had mixed feelings over the fact that she never really got full credit for her pop-culture influence . When mall shops ripped off and mass-produced her designs , Maripol ended up broke . If only I would have been smart , if only you could copyright the look which I do n t even know if it existed back then I would have been a multimillionaire , for sure , she says . I did go bankrupt because everybody copied me , every single industry . But genuinely , it does n t matter . I swear I do n t care . I became a freelance stylist to survive , and then I had a kid . I bankrupted in 1988 and had a kid in 1990 . I m very happy I have a beautiful son now . Eventually the chameleonic Madonna changed her style , many times over , and while Maripol was still involved with Madonna s later looks the sleek bustier outfit Madonna wore for her Marilyn Monroe-esque makeover in the Papa Do n t Preach video and the rubber dress she wore in the Express Yourself video s milk-lapping scene were both Maripol creations eventually Madonna moved on to other designers ( like Jean-Paul Gaultier , who created her early - 90s cone bra ) . I think Madonna might have a multiple personality . I know you [ think I am kidding ] , but I think it goes with the pain of losing your mother so young [ at age 5 ] . Multiple personality that s my theory , Maripol muses . But that is really excellent for her career , because she decides to really change her look , so people will never get bored of her . It s a genius strategy . She says she changes her music , but come on , the music has always been the same . Maripol has certainly kept busy in past years . Among her many endeavors , she has released four art books , most recently Maripola X , a collection of erotic Polaroids from the 1980s . I have a very young publisher , Adele Jancovici , and we really love each other and she s very smart , and I trusted her to open my secret box , she says of that book . They re all very sexy pictures of that period , of me mostly , but a lot of other people too . There is one for the first album cover of Madonna that was rejected by the record company that was never used . It s a genuinely beautiful picture of her , but it was not in line with Madonna as we knew her , with all the rubber and being like a little punky . We had beautiful pictures with her with sheets around her , beautiful lights and makeup , but they were all rejected . Maripol has also art-directed music videos for Cher , D Angelo , Elton John , and Luther Vandross contributed regularly to Document magazine collaborated on a line of vintage-inspired jewelry and T-shirts with Marc Jacobs launched a jewelry line called Atomic Glamour and directed Arte Creative s Keith Haring documentary , The Message . I also have multiple personalities , the artist laughs . With such a bustling career , Maripol once again stresses that she harbors no resentment toward Madonna , reasoning , I m very happy for her . And you know what ? In a way , I got the freedom to walk around in the street , and she does n t have that . And I think it s very difficult for her to not be able to have that freedom . Once you lose that freedom , does that make you more happy in life ? I ve always kept good relation with her and I really wish her the immense best , and I will get my claim of fame eventually .

		"paragraph": "Microsoft ( MSFT ) has had quite enough of ransomware attacks like WannaCry and Petya . But if the company is going to get a handle on the problem , it needs the help of customers , businesses and governments around the globe . When it comes to individuals and business , Microsoft has a simple request : Stop using Windows XP . As for the world s governments , Microsoft s ask is even easier , but may be a tougher sell : If you see something vulnerable in our software , tell us instead of using it to hack our customers . Neither task will be easy , but the alternative will result in continued waves of malware attacks that steal or destroy data and leave millions of computers immobilized . You might not know this from coverage that treats each new malware attack as something that magically happens out of nowhere , but when a computer gets infected you can usually pin the problem on two preexisting conditions . One is the person using the computer , who may be uninformed , gullible or distracted enough to open the wrong file or click on the wrong link . The other is the software running on the computer , which too often is obsolete and missing the latest security patches . Microsoft and other companies ca n t do much about the first problem beyond enhancing their systems to scan links and attachments in emails for signs of malicious content , something Microsoft recently did with its Office 365 software . But that sort of reactive defense can fall short when a previously unknown threat usually called zero-day exploits , for the lack of warning experts have about them starts to spread . Every company has at least one employee who will click on anything , Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith said in a keynote Wednesday at the company s Inspire conference in Washington . That is pretty hard to protect against . But companies can and should switch to more secure software that can better resist malware that sneaks in through email . And from Microsoft s perspective , that starts with retiring the ancient Windows XP . Despite Microsoft ending support for the operating system in 2014 , the 2001-vintage OS still powered 4.86 % of Windows PCs in June , according to StatCounter another research firm , NetMarketShare , found it on 6.94 % of PCs . XP is an easy mark for malware because it allows even strange programs complete access to the system once installed . Windows XP is enormously vulnerable in ways that are impossible to change , Smith said Wednesday . He noted that XP debuted two months before the Apple ( AAPL ) iPod , then asked Is there anybody in this arena who is carrying around an iPod ? But many companies will find that swapping out XP for the far-more-secure Windows 10 is a little more complicated than moving music from an MP3 player to a smartphone . They ll first have to upgrade their own specialized internal software to run properly on Win 10 or replaced it with Win 10-compatible equivalents . Companies and individual users also need to let go of the idea that they should be able to judge each security update on its merits . Doing so could mean important security gaps could go unplugged . So sorry , but you re going to have to trust Microsoft and Apple , Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) and others to download and install security fixes automatically . But Microsoft biggest challenge lies in trying to stop governments from uncovering and hoarding Windows vulnerabilities for offensive uses a practice of the National Security Agency that went awry when attackers posted a set of the agency s hacking tools online , which was then used to build the WannaCry ransomware . In February , Smith told a security conference that nations should adopt a Digital Geneva Convention that would commit them to avoiding malware attacks on civilian targets and require the prompt disclosure of vulnerabilities to the companies that need to fix them . Smith renewed his call on Wednesday , asking for collective action by nations to reduce the malware threat . He denounced hacking attempts that target political candidates and election systems such as Russia s extensive meddling in last year s presidential election as attacking the fundamental infrastructures of our time . Smith pledged that Microsoft would have no part in any such aggressive conduct . We will not help any government attack any customer anywhere , he said . We will help defend any customer anywhere . That stance may not get Microsoft any more business out of the Kremlin , but the Redmond , Washington firm is right to put principles over profits here . Unfortunately , there are too many software firms without such hangups . More from Rob : Email Rob at rob@robpegoraro.com follow him on Twitter at @robpegoraro . ",

[ Join a Yahoo Daily Fantasy Baseball contest now ] According to Tom Haudricourt of the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel , Jonathan Lucroy has elected to exercise his no-trade clause and veto a trade to the Cleveland Indians that would have brought four prospects back to Milwaukee . For the time being anyway , Lucroy is still with the Brewers , though there s still time for Milwaukee to swing another trade and there s still time for Cleveland to convince Lucroy to change his mind . In fact , it s reported that effort is well underway right now . It s almost certain Lucroy will require a new contract agreement to agree to a trade to a team on his no-trade list . The 30-year-old catcher earned a $ 4M salary this season and has a $ 5.2 M team option next season that Yahoo Sports Jeff Passan reports Lucroy would like to see torn up . For now , Lucroy is still with the Brewers in Milwaukee as they prepare to face the Pittsburgh Pirates . He was also available to the media , but shed little light on the circumstances of his decision . By vetoing the trade , Lucroy could be back in play for teams like the New York Mets and Texas Rangers , who were aggressive suitors prior to Cleveland emerging as the temporary winner . Another team could also emerge from the rubble to pull off a stunner . With some leverage potentially lost though , it s possible Milwaukee wo n t receive as strong a return . There are obviously a lot of variables involved , and there s still nearly 30 hours to get it sorted out . But we d say the trade deadline just got real .

		"paragraph": "Taylor Swift who started her career in country music three years after the Dixie Chicks were driven off airwaves for taking a stand against the Iraq invasion has always been careful not to talk politics . Until now , that is . In an Instagram post on Sunday , Swift disclosed that she would be voting in Tennessee in November for two Democrats : former governor-turned-Senate hopeful Phil Bredesen and Rep. Jim Cooper , whose district includes Nashville . In the past I ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions , but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years , I feel very differently about that now , Swift wrote . I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country . I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights , and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG . I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying , sickening and prevalent . But Swift did n t just throw her weight behind Bredesen , she savaged his opponent , Marsha Blackburn , calling the Trump-endorsed congresswoman out for her votes against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act , Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and her support of homophobic policies . She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples . She also believes they should not have the right to marry . These are not MY Tennessee values , Swift wrote . High-profile Republicans and anonymous white nationalists online were bereft . The National Republican Senate Committee put out a statement Monday declaring multimillionaire pop star Taylor Swift came down from her ivory tower to tell hardworking Tennesseans to vote for Phil Bredesen . Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee tweeted dismissively , So @taylorswift13 has every right to be political but it wo n t impact election unless we allow 13 yr old girls to vote . Still with #MarshaBlackburn . And conservative personality Candace Owens volunteered to campaign for Blackburn in Tennessee , writing that Swift was using black people and minorities as pawns to brainwash people into doing their bidding . Charlie Kirk , founder of Turning Point USA , a conservative group best known for wearing adult diapers to protest liberal policies on college campuses , suggested on Fox News Monday morning that Swift did n t believe what she wrote . I do n t want to accuse her of this , but I do n t think she s the only one who wrote that post on Instagram , Kirk said . She probably got some very bad information . On the website 4chan , where a community of White nationalists have embraced Swift as an Aryan queen whose political silence was a tacit admission of racist sympathies , several users floated similar theories . That looks so ghost written . Ever notice how every celebrity seems to be reciting the same exact script and even use the same wording , one user wrote . Another added : All PR nonsense , she just does n t want to be labeled a white nationalist . Probably got paid to say all this . Users were nonetheless stricken by the development . OUR GIRL no more , one posted . They took her from us and turned her into one of their brain dead zombies , another wrote . Swift s endorsement is not without commercial risk . According to an analysis by the New York Times , she is most popular in rural areas in the West and Midwest that tend to vote conservative , like Utah , Montana and Nevada , and only modestly popular in Tennessee . Maybe an endorsement of Nevada candidate Jacky Rosen is next ?",

		"paragraph": "MONZA , Italy ( AP ) For Ferrari , the wait continues . For Lewis Hamilton , it was a dream race . Hamilton won the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday after starting third on the grid to extend his championship lead over Sebastian Vettel following an opening-lap collision with the German driver that effectively ended his chances of victory . Ferrari had been hopeful of ending an eight-year wait for a win at its home track after taking the front two places on the grid at the Italian GP for the first time since 2000 . However , pole-sitter Raikkonen was overtaken by Hamilton eight laps from the end and the Mercedes driver held on , much to the disappointment of the passionate Italian tifosi fans . \" Today was so difficult . Whilst the negativity is never great , that 's what powered me along . I actually accept it , \" Hamilton said after getting roundly booed on the podium . Hamilton , who said he rated the win as among the top performances of his career , tied Michael Schumacher 's record of five Italian GP victories and extended his overall lead to 30 points over Vettel \" Disappointed but there was nothing I could do , \" said Raikkonen , who struggled with a tire problem in the final few laps . Hamilton 's teammate Valtteri Bottas was third , ahead of Vettel and Red Bull 's Max Verstappen , who received a five-second penalty . The 33-year-old Hamilton pinpointed the collision with Vettel as the decisive moment of the race . \" That was definitely a very , very key moment , getting past him was the immediate goal ... my race is not really with Kimi , it 's with Sebastian . However , I do need to get past Kimi at the same time , \" Hamilton said . \" Getting past Sebastian at the beginning was clearly a massive turning point . That definitely took a lot of pressure off ... I could just focus on Kimi for the whole race . We had a couple of good battles . \" Vettel had cut the gap at the top of the standings to 17 points with victory at last weekend 's Belgium GP . Hamilton put his rival under pressure from the start but Vettel pulled clear and was alongside Raikkonen into the first corner . Hamilton had another go on the outside heading into the second chicane , inching ahead of Vettel when they made contact , causing Vettel to spin and lose part of his front wing . The safety car was deployed and Vettel was forced into the pits for a new wing , coming out 18th . Both drivers complained on team radio but an investigation decided that no further action was necessary . \" Obviously I guess Lewis saw his chance but he did n't leave me any room so I got spun around and could n't avoid what happened , \" said Vettel . \" It could have been the other way , which would have been nicer for us , but was n't and I was facing the wrong way . \" We did well to come back given the damage that we had . \" There are seven races left on the calendar , including the Singapore GP on Sept. 16 on a track which suits Ferrari . \" There are many points to win back now in the championship , but we still have time to improve and we have the margin to recover , \" Vettel said . Moments after the safety car came in on lap four , Hamilton swiftly overtook Raikkonen on the straight but gave the lead back almost immediately at the second chicane . Meanwhile , Vettel was powering through the field and had made it back into the top 10 by lap 15 and was up to fifth nine laps later . But the German 's hopes of getting onto the podium were diminished when he was forced to make another pit stop and came out 10th . Raikkonen pitted from the lead at the end of lap 20 and came out fourth , behind Hamilton , Bottas and Verstappen . Hamilton waited until the end of lap 28 to come in for fresh tires , handing the lead to Bottas who was ahead of a charging Raikkonen . Hamilton emerged third and , with his teammate holding up Raikkonen , the British driver was able to close the gap . When Bottas eventually pitted at the end of lap 36 , the fight was on , with Raikkonen holding a one-second advantage over Hamilton . A few laps later Hamilton struck , coming around the outside of Raikkonen on turn one at the end of the straight to overtake the Finn and never looked back . Behind them there was a scrap for third place culminating at the first chicane when Verstappen appeared to move into Bottas , forcing the Finnish driver onto an escape road . Verstappen was furious when told he had been given a five-second penalty for his role in the incident on team radio , swearing and adding : \" They 're doing a great job of killing racing , honestly . \" More AP auto racing : https://apnews.com/tag/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP Sports",

		"paragraph": "WASHINGTON ( AP ) The White House is brushing aside threats by Saudi Arabia that it may economically retaliate for any U.S. punitive action imposed over the suspected murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi , pledging a \" swift , open , transparent investigation \" into his disappearance . Two leading Republican senators said Congress stands ready to act , including a possible halt of military sales , if President Donald Trump does n't . White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow declined to speculate on what Trump might do after the president promised \" severe punishment \" in a \" 60 Minutes \" interview , if the U.S. determines that Khashoggi was indeed killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul . On Sunday , the oil-rich kingdom suggested retaliation if the U.S. were to impose strict measures . Trump has said he does not want to halt a proposed $ 110 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia because , he maintained , it would harm U.S. manufacturers . \" We will take stern action with the Saudis if necessary , \" Kudlow said . \" The United States is the dominant energy player so we 're in pretty good shape , in my opinion , with our energy boom to cover any shortfalls . We 'll wait and see , but rest assured that when the president says we will take actions if we find out bad outcomes , he means it . \" Kudlow also said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would be attending a Saudi conference this week to address terrorist financing , but those plans could change as details of the investigation become available . \" The president several times said we want a prompt , swift , open , transparent investigation , \" Kudlow said . Sens. Marco Rubio and Jeff Flake , members of the Foreign Relations Committee , said Congress was prepared to move quickly and firmly if Trump failed to adequately respond to the Oct. 2 disappearance of Khashoggi , a Washington Post contributor who had written columns critical of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman . Rubio said U.S.-Saudi relations may need to be \" completely revised \" and stressed the U.S. would lose credibility on human rights if the Trump administration remained silent . He also said Mnuchin should skip the Saudi conference . \" I do n't think any of our government officials should be going and pretending it 's business as usual until we know what 's happened here , \" said Rubio , R-Fla . Rubio declined to rule out a halt to the arms sales , stressing that the U.S. must send a message to repressive governments worldwide , from Russia to Syria and China . \" There 's not enough money in the world for us to buy back our credibility on human rights if we do not move forward and take swift action , \" Rubio said . \" Arms sales are important not because of the money but because it also provides leverage over their future behavior . \" Flake said if the Saudis did , in fact , kill Khashoggi , Congress might specifically curtail U.S. military aid to Saudi-led forces in Yemen . Saudi Arabia is leading a coalition of Gulf states in a military campaign against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen . The U.S. provides weaponry , intelligence and logistical support for the bombing campaign . \" I do think that arms sales will be affected . Certainly our involvement in Yemen with Saudi Arabia will be affected , \" said Flake , R-Ariz . More than 20 Republican and Democratic senators instructed Trump last week to order an investigation into Khashoggi 's disappearance under legislation that authorizes sanctions for perpetrators of extrajudicial killings , torture or other gross human rights violations . The writer had been living in self-exile in Virginia for the past year . The lawmakers ' letter was a preliminary step under the Global Magnitsky Act toward taking punitive action . Sen. Bob Corker , R-Tenn. , who as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has reviewed the U.S. intelligence into what happened to Khashoggi , has said , \" The likelihood is he was killed on the day he walked into the consulate . \" Turkish officials say that they fear Saudi agents killed and dismembered Khashoggi after he entered the consulate and that they have audio and video recordings of it . The kingdom has called the allegations \" baseless \" but has offered no evidence the writer left the consulate . Trump visited the kingdom on his first overseas trip as president and has touted arms sales to Saudi Arabia . Prodded Saturday to specify what type of \" severe punishment \" he could impose , Trump demurred . \" Well , there are many things we can do . Would you like to speak up about that ? \" he said , turning to Sen. James Lankford , R-Okla. , who was at the White House for the arrival of American pastor Andrew Brunson , who was released from Turkey after nearly two years of confinement . \" I do n't want to put you on the spot , but if you guys would like to tell them some of the many things we can do . There 's a big list . \" Lankford responded : \" Yeah , there 's a big list . Obviously , we have a long-standing partnership with Saudi Arabia in a lot of areas . \" He added , \" Let 's find out what did happen first . \" Rubio appeared on CNN 's \" State of the Union , \" NBC 's \" Meet the Press \" and CBS ' \" Face the Nation , \" Flake spoke on ABC 's \" This Week , \" and Kudlow also was on ABC and \" Fox News Sunday . \"",

		"paragraph": "Recently , my children began lobbying to watch a movie called Descendants . They d heard about it at their after-school program , where the soundtrack blared Did I mention that I m in love with you ? as the kids shot baskets and acted out the parts on the playground . I read up on it , quickly realizing I had a lot of catching up to do ( Descendants 2 left fans hanging in 2017 , and Descendants 3 was announced just recently with the exciting release of a trailer ) . It sounded like a clever enough idea : The children of various Disney villains Belle s adversary , Maleficent , and Snow White s nemesis , the Evil Queen , among them go to an exclusive boarding school with the children of the royals on whom those villains have preyed ( and , at first , conspire to take it over and let evil reign ) . Now , I m pretty well prepared to combat the princess media . I have had discussions with my daughters , 6 and 8 , about the limits of those royalty-rooted narratives , in which huge-eyed , tiny-waisted young women wealthy , beautiful , yet somehow powerless must be rescued by men . I knew , also , to teach them to recognize the whiteness of those worlds , and how heteronormative they were , with almost all straight and cisgendered characters . But I was not prepared for one consistent element of children s media something on full display in the endless stream of kids movies , from the Descendants franchise to the soon-to-be-released summer attractions Incredibles 2 , Show Dogs , and Transylvania 3 : Summer Vacation . And that , my friends , was romance . Much of Descendants , for example , centers on the budding love between Maleficent s daughter Mal and Sleeping Beauty s son Ben he even asks , Do you love me ? on the first date . ( Granted , he d been chowing on some love potion-laden chocolate chip cookies , but make no mistake , his love is real . ) To paraphrase my daughters when they see starry-eyed young boys and girls on the small or big screen about to kiss : Ewww . Boy-meets-girl is as old a narrative device as , say , Adam and Eve . Romance novels are a billion-dollar industry . Romance-fueled narratives are everywhere , but I have found myself increasingly agitated and confounded by their presence and prevalence in kids media . Still , I could n t quite put my finger on why , so I called a couple of experts to unpack it with me . The biggest problem with romance in kids media , says Sierra Filucci , executive editor of parenting content at Common Sense Media , a nonprofit that reviews children s media and technology , is that it is largely found in films and shows targeted at girls . If a female is the central character , most often there is a romantic storyline , Filucci says . Boy-oriented stories are full of action and adventure , of agency and independence . Girl-oriented stories are full of angsty ladies hoping to win the favor of boys , by way of primping and preening and passivity . The search for a man s affection or approval , says Rebecca Hains , a children s media culture expert and professor of media and communication at Salem State University , is presented as the be-all and end-all of life . All the other things we want for our girls mostly to have that action , adventure , agency , and independence that boys have take a back seat to the pursuit of romance . If the only story that is consistently being delivered to girls is that romance is wonderful and you should pursue it and make yourself appealing so you can have a heteronormative romance , well , what about all the parts of life that are very interesting ? asks Hains . There are so many aspects of life besides romance . It happens early and often , she says , that we essentially sell boys and girls on two different worlds , laying out gender-based norms that have very little rooting in reality . In general , boys and girls have so much more in common , Hains says . But our media reinforces the idea that boys and girls are different and sets children on pathways to imagine that there are many more differences than similarities . These kinds of messages can affect the way they think about themselves and the way they think about others . Hains notes that these messages do n t just get filtered into our kids brains they can help shape behavior , lifelong beliefs , and even public policy . What we come to believe is the natural normal order of things as children shapes our worldviews , and might have more influence on what we advocate for as adults , she says . Boys , for instance , may learn that they re not supposed to crave love and affection the way girls should . We have the idea that masculinity is not compatible with nurturing , she says , which , one could argue , affects both our cultural attitudes toward and our laws about things like paternity leave . Noting the number of hands-on dads , she says , It s so out of step with modern life . Meanwhile , women are still expected to place men and family first , no matter what they achieve emotional labor always takes precedence . Even if you have a great job and you re a scientist who invents robots , if you re a woman you re going to be responsible for all these other things , Hains says . If you re a great scientist but not a great mom , there s something wrong with you . This does n t mean you need to filter out all romantic storylines . It s impossible to put children in a bubble where they do n t see all those stories , says Filucci . I do n t think cutting them off from what their friends are experiencing is effective , because it can become this forbidden fruit . Certainly that was the case for this writer . The ban on soap operas in my house growing up precisely because my parents objected to how they promulgated the notion that love justifies everything only led to me sneaking General Hospital and surrendering my allowance to my older brother so he would n t tell . Instead , have a healthy media mix . It s not bad to show your kid a story that has some romance in it , but it s important to balance that with other stuff . Counterbalance those storylines and give them lots of nonstereotypical films , TV shows , and books , Filucci suggests . Certainly , there are many more choices than there used to be . Both Frozen and Maleficent , two Disney franchises , play to our romantic expectations by setting up a problem death , or the approximation of it that can be solved only with true love s kiss . But spoiler alerts in both movies , the male love interest is n t able to save the day the kiss has to come from someone who feels familial love . ( Meanwhile , speculation is rampant that Elsa may have a lesbian love interest in the upcoming Frozen sequel . ) Moana was blessedly romance-free , and the character of Rae in the new iterations of Star Wars is searching for her place in the universe , not a prince to rescue her . The role models are out there . And they re getting better . But there is work to do . Hains notes that , even in the female-centric Frozen , men have more than 50 percent of the dialogue . ( Not the case in Maleficent , though the men are largely incidental in that script . ) Talking , in fact , is the perfect antidote . Talk back at the screen with them . Talk about what s happening on the screen with them , Hains says . Make sure that your kids know you do n t necessarily agree that what s being presented is normal . No problem with that in this household I am regularly groaning during the romance scenes in Descendants . So it s good to know this is actually the prescription for creating mini media critics , and not just that I ca n t keep my mouth shut . And liking storylines beyond romance is , in fact , normal for females . These days , at least according to one study , women are far keener on action films than romantic comedies . Soap operas have all but vanished . It s up to us , the parents , to present them with these alternatives , to expand their definition of normal . It does take a little effort to seek out the alternative , says Filucci . But not that much more . Filucci says she s met many parents who complain about the princess problem , only to turn around and buy their kids a set of princess dolls for Christmas . You have more control than you think , she says . You just have to exert it . For our part , we re finishing up yet another screening of Descendants , replete with my objections , mini-lectures , and annotations . The kids love it anyway .

During Variety s inaugural Path to Parity women s summit on Wednesday , the actress and mother of two shared that becoming a mom has made her more confident in her own decisions . When asked whether she ever worries about burning bridges when turning down projects because of unfair wages , for instance , she said she used to , but no longer . In response , interviewer and journalist Jenelle Riley said this confidence was a skill people have to learn , to which Kunis responded by crediting motherhood . You know what ? I became a mom , she said . I had better things to concern myself with than some stranger s opinion of whether or not I was a bitch . When I became a mom , so many things that I used to be insecure about and concern myself with no longer mattered , she continued . She also found more power in turning things down . The ability to say ‘ no had a purpose , she said . This is not the first time that Kunis has spoken about rising above other people s opinions . In 2016 , she told Vanity Fair she did n t care what other people thought of her breastfeeding in public . It did n t matter to me what other people thought , she said . That s what I chose to do , but I think it s unfortunate that people are so hard on women who choose to do it and do it in public . She has also spoken of the importance of removing herself from the constant mom competition . It s the competitive energy that is so destructive , she told PopSugar in 2016 . We re all in it together . You only are a mommy in this way for such a brief amount of time anyway that you do n t want to look back and be like , ‘ Why did I care about that stupid nonsense ? Emma Bennett , a licensed psychotherapist who specializes in maternal mental health , is thrilled with Kunis s outlook . The hope and the goal in a lot of my treatment with moms is to shed the outside noise that is pulling them down and to rebuild their confidence , she tells Yahoo Lifestyle . We want to get to a place where moms are feeling OK with being good enough and feel confident in the way that they are taking care of their family . Bennett sees Kunis as embracing her new role . With the birth of any child , there s a birth of a new person : your identity as a mother . I think that she really has embraced her identity since becoming a mom , she says . Things can really shift . Her priorities really changed , and what really matters to her is her children and her family . And the excess nonsense that she was kind of bogged down by seems obsolete . Bennett is particularly impressed by Kunis s ability to say no . She understands her time has so much more weight and value now , because anytime a mom is away from her child … that means a lot more once you become a mom , she says . Everyone has the potential to get to this place , Bennett promises . Kunis definitely has a lot of resources that other moms do n t have , but that being said , I do n t think this level of self-confidence is unattainable .

		"paragraph": "When New Orleans thrashed the Portland Trail Blazers in a first-round sweep , concern surfaced that a Golden State team without Stephen Curry may be vulnerable to Anthony Davis Pelicans . The Warriors quickly put those concerns to rest for a game at least in a dominant 123-101 Game 1 win with Curry still sidelined with an MCL sprain suffered on March 23 . They were so good , in fact , that the conversation shifted to whether it made sense to bring Curry back from Game 2 or let him continue to heal in anticipation of a Western Conference finals showdown with the Houston Rockets . Such is the state of the NBA . Alas , Warriors coach Steve Kerr opted to bring Curry back for Tuesday s Game 2 , and for Golden State , it s a good thing he did . The Warriors needed everything their superstar guard could muster in a 121-116 win over New Orleans to take a 2-0 series lead . Kerr opted to ease Curry back in , bringing him off the bench . Curry provided an instant spark when he entered the game at the 4:20 mark of the first quarter and New Orleans leading , 19-11 . After receiving a roaring ovation from the Oracle Arena crowd , he almost immediately drained a three-pointer from the wing on a designed play off a screen . Three minutes later , Curry had added a layup and a trademark 32-footer to turn the game s momentum in favor of the Warriors . By the time he left the game with 7:50 remaining in the second quarter , Golden State held a 40-38 lead , good for a 10-point swing . A Klay Thompson buzzer-beater at the half combined with a 5-0 Warriors run to start the third quarter gave Golden State a 63-55 lead in what looked like might be the game-changing run . The Pelicans were game , though and punched back playing a physical game focused on getting the ball inside to Davis . And they thrived once again with Curry on the bench , rallying with an 11-2 run to take back a 66-65 lead before Curry returned to the game . Davis owned the paint , tallying 25 points , 15 rebounds , five assists and three blocks as Golden State made life on the perimeter tough for New Orleans . The Pelicans had enough to keep things close until about halfway through the fourth quarter , when Golden State held a 99-98 lead with 7:48 left . But the Warriors found their run , this time led by Kevin Durant who scored six straight as Golden State reeled off 11 unanswered points . And while Curry was n t scoring during that run , he was on the floor for nine of those 11 points . In the end , Curry led Golden State with 28 points , seven rebounds and three steals with 5-10 shooting from distance in 27 minutes . The most telling stat was his plus-26 in the plus/minus column . Whenever he was on the bench , the Pelicans thrived . Whenever he was in the game , he doused their hopes . Durant ( -5 ) and Thompson ( -8 ) combined to shoot 4-for-18 from distance while logging minuses in the plus/minus column . Draymond Green was at his best , posting 20 points , 12 assists and nine rebounds while getting under the skin of the Pelicans , most notably Rajon Rondo . Durant scored 29 , but Green was Golden State s best starter . Unlike Game 1 , the Pelicans came to play on Tuesday , getting 24 points , eight rebounds and eight assists from Jrue Holiday and a remarkable line of 22 points , 12 assists , seven rebounds , five steals and seven turnovers from Rondo . Any talk of the Warriors holding Curry for a presumed matchup with the Rockets seems silly in hindsight . Tuesday looked like a night where they might not have won if not for the heroics of their star point guard .

		"paragraph": "Comcast s $ 65 billion bid for 21st Century Fox ( FOX ) is the largest all-cash offer in history , but analysts overwhelmingly are expecting the Walt Disney Co. to top it . Equity analysts and market watchers say that Disney has room to increase its bid and given chief executive Bob Iger s proclivity for dealmaking they expect the company to do just that . We believe Disney ( DIS ) has the flexibility to sweeten its current deal with cash , UBS analyst John C. Hodulik said in a note with the bank s equity team to clients . Disney does have a stronger balance sheet and higher stock valuation than Comcast . Comcast ( CMCSA ) holds more debt or leverage on its balance sheet than Disney , the analysts note , even though Comcast currently trades at five times its earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) , the analysts note , which they call a historic and absolute low . ( EBITDA can be used to analyze and compare profitability among companies and industries as it eliminates the effects of financing and accounting decisions . ) A deal with either Comcast or Disney would involve the buyer taking over Fox s cable networks , its international holdings , regional sports networks like Fox Sports Southwest and its film studio . The Fox News and national sports networks , which have been called the Murdoch family s crown jewels , would be spun off and remain under the family s control . At stake is a deal that would create a global content and distribution company , with leading platforms in the U.S. , Europe and India . With Fox s assets , the UBS analysts estimate Comcast would generate around 55 % of its pro forma EBITDA from U.S. cable , followed by 37 % from media and 8 % from Sky . It would also significantly increase Comcast s international exposure . Bloomberg Opinion columnist Tara LaChapelle says both the Murdochs and Disney clearly want the merger to take place and seem committed . Disney has a five-day window during which it has the right to match Comcast s offer . I suspect it will add some cash to its offer mix if that s what it will take to win a shareholder vote come July , LaChapelle said in an opinion piece . Disney is already six months into this deal and to some degree , both sides have already been talking about it as if it s in the bag . Oppenheimer analysts Timothy Horan and Tom Shaughnessy similarly expect a rejoinder from Disney , they said in a note titled Comcast Makes Formal Fox Offer Disney Likely to Top the Bid of Last Remaining Major Content Company . Both potential acquirers are seeing increases in their share prices . Disney s stock was up 2.4 % in pre-market futures trading Friday , having gained 4.2 % from its market close on Monday to its close on Thursday . Comcast s stock jumped 4.2 % in futures trading Friday , having gained 5.6 % between its Monday and Thursday close . While the company may not want to see Fox s assets slip through its fingers , Disney outbidding the cable giant could be a good thing , argues Moody s lead analyst Neil Begley . He rates Comcast s current $ 65 billion bid as credit negative . The total pro forma debt for the combined companies would be approximately $ 170 billion of total debt , the world s second-most indebted company ( excluding financial institutions and government-related entities ) after pro forma AT&T - Time Warner once it closes , Begley said in a statement . Assuming about $ 40 billion of EBITDA after synergies , pro forma leverage would be about 4.25 times , which represents a material change in financial risk tolerance for Comcast ‘ s AAA longterm debt ratings .

		"paragraph": "I write about Meghan Markle so often that sometimes I forget I am not the Duchess of Sussex myself . I know what went into her wedding-day messy bun , and I 've meticulously searched the internet to find ( then run out and buy ) every single beauty product the royal knows and loves . Heck , I even know what her nuptial dressing room smelled like . So when I heard that one of Markle 's favorite cleansers just got reformulated , I had to pull a Beyonc and upgrade my own face wash routine , too . Back in 2014 , a pre-Harry Markle told Allure that she \" really loved \" the Tatcha Rice Enzyme Powder ( $ 65 ) . \" It just sort of foams on your face and gives you a really subtle exfoliation , \" she said . Four years later , the J-beauty brand has revamped the item to be suitable for all skin types . There 's a classic option for normal to combination skin deep , which unclogs oily pores gentle , to quell dry flakes and calming , to soothe irritated complexions . Image Source : Getty / Samir Hussein Whichever works best for you , Tatcha just made all iterations a lot more gentle by switching the base to a pH-neutral amino acid . This means that unlike harsh , traditional soaps , the formula that 's responsible for Markle 's sparkle wo n't strip your skin of its natural nutrients . I managed to get my hands on an early sample of the new cleanser the day after recovering from a gnarly breakout , so I got to test the validity of the brand 's gentle claims . After putting a pea-sized amount of this powder on my hands , I splashed just a bit of warm water onto it and rubbed it on my face for about eight seconds before washing off . Normally , I 'm not crazy about scrubs , because I find them to be really irritating , especially over acne . But like Markle said , it lathered into a really soft , plush foam that felt both moisturizing and pore-clearing . The morning after I tried it , I tiptoed to my medicine cabinet mirror afraid that I 'd awake to finding myself a splotchy , red mess , because so many severe products can make me that way . And all I can say is - Markle , I never should have doubted you . I may not have that look-of-love twinkle that comes with marrying a foreign prince , but I also do n't have any surprise breakouts , either . I 'll take what I can get .

		"paragraph": "Millions of Fornite gamers may have allowed hackers to download malicious apps onto their phones without ever realising . A serious flaw in the first Fortnite installer - an app that helps users download the game on their Android phones - allowed any app on a user s phone to silently install other apps . The discovery was made by Google s security team after Fornite maker , Epic Games , decided to release its own installer as a way to bypass the Google Play Store . The Google Play Store is the app store for Android phones , used on smartphone models from Samsung , Sony and Huawei . It is considered a more secure way to download apps from the internet , which could contain viruses or malware . But Fortnite , the widely popular cartoon-like online game where players compete in a \" battle royale \" , is n t featured . Instead , Epic Games decided to skip using the Google Play store to distribute Fornite so that it could avoid paying Google a 30pc cut of its game s revenue . Google 's security team first disclosed the vulnerability privately to Epic Games on August 15 . Epic Games said it fixed the issue within hours of being informed . Google found that the installer was vulnerable to what is known as a \" man-in-the-disk \" attack . Fortnite downloads an APK , which is the package for Android apps , stores it locally and then launches it . The installer , however , only checked that the name of the APK was right . If a file wascalled com.epicgames.fortnite , it would launch it , regardless of whether it was fake or malicious . This means hackers could intercept the request to download Fornite and download something else instead , such as spyware . Ahead of its release on Android , cyber security company Sophos warned the decision to bypass the Google Play store could backfire . \" [ It ] risks undermining one of the simplest , most useful and easiest to remember pieces of security advice we can offer : stick to Google Play , it said . NCC chief technology officer Ollie Whitehouse told the Telegraph : \" It is not what we would recommend . There is a lot of effort put into securing these stores , and this is setting a precedent .

		"paragraph": "Before describing one of the most traumatic experiences of her life in front of the world , 51-year-old professor Christine Blasey Ford reiterated that she was n t testifying against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh because she wanted to she was there because she believes it to be her civic duty to inform senators about the Kavanaugh she knows , so that they can decide whether he deserves a lifetime appointment on the highest federal court in the United States . When Ford was in high school in the 1980s , she claims that Kavanaugh covered her mouth and attempted to rape her at a party an incident that left her dealing with PTSD and claustrophobia for the rest of her life , and which she detailed in a heartbreaking opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday . Ford s testimony was released the night before the hearing , and she read it nearly word-for-word . But this was the public s first time hearing her voice , observing her demeanor , witnessing her bravery . As senator Chuck Grassley delivered his opening statement , Ford was palpably nervous early into her testimony , she admitted that she was terrified . As she continued to speak , her voice trembled , but she powered through her prepared statement , barely breaking as she described the alleged assault and the moment she thought Kavanaugh might kill her . Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming , she told the Committee . This was what terrified me the most , and has had the most lasting impact on my life . It was hard for me to breathe , and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me . She also revealed the devastating moment she revealed the alleged sexual assault to her husband in 2012 . In a couple s counseling session , when she and her husband were remodeling their home , she insisted that she wanted to have a second front door a request her husband did not understand at the time . It was then that Ford opened up about her night with Kavanaugh , and the way in which has caused her to suffer from claustrophobia . In explaining why I wanted to have a second front door , I described the assault in detail , she told the Senate Judiciary Committee . I recall saying that the boy who assaulted me could someday be on the U.S. Supreme Court and spoke a bit about his background . My husband recalls that I named my attacker as Brett Kavanaugh . ( Kavanaugh has denied assaulting Ford , or any woman . ) To conclude her testimony , Ford spoke of what her life has been the past couple of weeks , which she considers to be the hardest of [ her ] life , apart from the alleged assault . I have had to relive my trauma in front of the entire world , and have seen my life picked apart by people on television , in the media , and in this body who have never met me or spoken with me , she said , before proving her strength . Those who say that do not know me . I am a fiercely independent person and I am no one s pawn . My motivation in coming forward was to provide the facts about how Mr. Kavanaugh s actions have damaged my life , so that you can take that into serious consideration as you make your decision about how to proceed .

		"paragraph": "With more networks and streaming services getting into original programming everyday , the demand for televised content is greater than ever . In Adapt This ! we spotlight a piece of previously unadapted material we d love to see become a TV series and even suggest a potential network and creative team . The Handmaid s Tale Source Material : Margaret Atwood s 1985 novel features one of the most chilling dystopias ever created , one that at the time and still today functions as a powerful and necessary argument in favor of women s rights . Thumbnail Synopsis : Unhappy with America s increasingly progressive direction , a devoutly right-wing faction of the government successfully executes a coup that results in the founding of the Republic of Gilead . In this brave new world , women are subjugated to the will and authority of men and divided into eight distinct classes . Wives are perched atop this government-mandated social strata , followed by daughters and then handmaids , a concubine class tasked with the job of continuing the human race , as sterility is on the rise . Atwood s narrative is framed as the life and times of one particular handmaiden , Offred , who , in another life before the fall , had a family of her own . Now , she lives in the unhappy home of the high-ranking Commander and his bitter wife , Serena Joy , a one-time televangelist who preached the gospel the men of Gilead claim to be honoring . Related : Why Spider-Girl Needs Her Own Series Why It Would Make Great TV : For starters , Atwood s prose is so vivid , you can see the television series in your mind s eye while reading the book . And then there s Gilead itself , a multi-layered world that s idyllic on the surface and rotten at the core . During the course of the novel , the author expertly peels away the lies and hypocrisies this society is founded on , while at the same time setting Offred on a journey towards empowerment . It s a slow-burn arc that benefits from the kind of breathing room that a limited series can provide . Each episode could take the time to flesh out the conventions and customs of Gilead , from The Ceremony ( the union of Commander and Handmaiden , where the latter lies on top of the Wife while the man attends to business ) to the schools where stern Aunts train the next generation of concubines . Entire episodes could also be given over to key chapters in the novel , including the elaborate preparations for one handmaiden s ritual birth , as well as the Commander s night out with Offred at a brothel , where she encounters a familiar face from her past . With more screen time comes more opportunities to preserve the rich details and nuance in Atwood s prose that s one of the many reasons why the deservedly forgotten 1990 movie version of The Handmaid s Tale failed . That film , which starred Natasha Richardson as Offred and Robert Duvall as the Commander , efficiently recreated the broad outlines of the world described on the page , without really communicating what makes Atwood s dystopia so unsettling the notion that it could happen here . Given that it was written in the mid - ‘ 80s , when the so-called Moral Majority was in its ascendency and strictly enforcing traditional definitions of marriage and gender roles , The Handmaid s Tale should ideally feel a relic in an age where American society has made enormous strides towards true equality between the sexes . And yet , the pointed belittling of female politicians ( be it Hillary Clinton or Sarah Palin ) , the dwindling access in certain states to lawful reproductive rights , and the challenges women face in reporting sexual violence on college campuses continue to illustrate Handmaid s relevance . ( The parallels to some of the more theocratic Middle Eastern societies are all too apparent and timely as well . ) The Handmaid s Tale and George Orwell s 1984 are often yoked together because their respective dystopias hold a mirror up to our own past and present . But where the dominant emotion in 1984 is terror , Offred s rebellion is ultimately driven by anger anger that her body , her history , and her personhood has been reclaimed by a male-dominated ruling class more concerned with dictating her behavior than their own . Creative Dream Team : The big-screen version of The Handmaid s Tale was a stolid , stiff adaptation , but the series ca n t and should n t be that coldly clinical even if Gilead prizes dutiful restraint over forceful individualism . Enter Jill Soloway , creator of Amazon s breakout series Transparent and the uneven , but deeply felt indie film , Afternoon Delight . Both are constructed around the idea of women Kathryn Hahn s frustrated stay-at-home mom in Afternoon Delight and Jeffry Tambor s evolving Moppa in Transparent butting up against society s expectations of them . Purposefully messy and imprecise , Soloway s work achieves the lasting resonance you d want from an adaptation of The Handmaid s Tale . Given their past collaborations , Hahn would seem like a natural candidate for Offred , but she d actually make a better Moira an important friend from the heroine s past . That clears the lead role for Sarah Paulson , freeing her from the American Horror Story machine and handing her the role that will finally win her an Emmy . Ideal Network : HBO is the only logical place , seeing as how they have the budget this kind of adaptation requires , as well as the tradition of prestige miniseries based on popular books ( see also : Mildred Pierce and The Casual Vacancy ) and the interest in provocative sexual content as demonstrated by all the boobs ‘ n butts on your average episode of Game of Thrones . The Handmaid s Tale is available for purchase ( or as a free Kindle edition ) on Amazon .",

That she died might not have come as a big surprise , but the exact circumstances of Sasha s death and how it impacted her friends in Alexandria made for a sad , shocking end for the character who had emerged as one of the biggest heroes of The Walking Dead Season 7 . Sasha whose portrayer , Sonequa Martin-Green , had already been announced as the star of the upcoming Star Trek : Discovery series on CBS All Access was taken to Alexandria by Negan , where he was going to use her as a bargaining chip before doling out punishment to Rick for his plot to overthrow Negan and the Saviors . Sasha was transported to Alexandria in a coffin . Negan planned to pop it open and reveal her to her friends , but she was the one with the surprise : When he opened the burial box , Sasha or rather , walker Sasha jumped on him . She had taken Eugene s suicide pill , and reanimated just in time to turn Negan s plan around on him temporarily . But the baddie with the bat had more tricks up his sleeve . As fans had been theorizing , Jadis and her Heapsters , supposed allies to the Alexandrians after Rick and company secured a cache of weapons for them , turned on Rick , holding he and his people hostage with those very guns . Just as Negan planned to make Carl s head and Rick s hands Lucille s latest victims , it was another pair of women who saved the day : Carol , accompanied by Ezekiel , Morgan , and the Kingdomites , and Maggie , with her Hilltop army , arrived with their own guns blazing , to save Rick and Carl , and help the rest of the Alexandrians run Negan out of town . Oh , make that a trio of ladies : Ezekiel s tiger , Shiva , also did her part in shutting down some Saviors and Heapsters and driving them out of Alexandria . Sasha , thanks to some flashbacks and a surprise guest appearance by former cast member Michael Cudlitz , at least had some fond memories of her all too brief romance with Abraham before her death .

		"paragraph": "By Steve Gorman and Daniel Trotta ( Reuters ) - A Florida sheriff came under mounting criticism on Sunday for his deputies ' response to this month 's deadly high school shooting and potential warning signs as dozens of state lawmakers called for his ouster and the governor ordered an independent inquiry . Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel insisted that only one of his armed deputies is so far known to have been at fault for staying outside the school while it was under attack rather than entering to confront the gunman who shot 17 people to death . That deputy , identified as the school 's assigned resource officer , Scot Petersen , has resigned rather than face suspension and possible dismissal after his actions were caught on video during the massacre , the sheriff acknowledged last week . News outlets including CNN and NBC have since reported that at least three more armed Broward County sheriff 's deputies were present on the scene , taking cover behind their vehicles instead of immediately going into the school . Israel sought to dismiss those reports , based on unnamed sources from the neighboring Coral Springs Police Department , which also responded to the shooting . \" Our investigation to this point shows that during this horrific attack , while this killer was inside the school , there was only one law enforcement person , period , and that was former deputy Scot Peterson , \" Israel said in a CNN interview on Sunday . Israel did not rule out , however , that the investigation could find other deputies who failed to act properly during or immediately after the Feb. 14 rampage , which authorities said lasted about six or seven minutes . The sheriff said separately on Twitter that he welcomed an investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement , as requested by Governor Rick Scott , to examine the response by local police and the sheriff 's office . \" This independent , outside review will ensure public confidence in the findings , \" Israel said . Fourteen students and three adult educators were slain when a gunman opened fire with a semiautomatic AR-15-style assault rifle inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland , an affluent suburb of Fort Lauderdale . Nikolas Cruz , a 19-year-old former student who was expelled last year for disciplinary problems , was later arrested and charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder . Authorities have said Cruz made his getaway moments after the shooting by blending in with students fleeing the school and was later apprehended after strolling through a nearby Walmart store and stopping at two fast-food outlets . The sheriff rejected calls for his removal as politically motivated and defended his department from criticism that his deputies overlooked a number of telltale signs that Cruz posed a threat of violence . \" I can only take responsibility for what I knew about , \" Israel , a Democrat , told CNN , adding that he had \" given amazing leadership \" since he was first elected sheriff in 2012 . Besides Peterson 's resignation , Israel has previously said two other deputies have been placed on restricted duty pending an internal review of whether they properly handled two telephone tips - from 2016 and 2017 - warning that Cruz was collecting weapons and might be inclined to commit a school shooting . The sheriff told CNN on Sunday that 16 other \" calls for service \" his department received about Cruz before the massacre were properly handled . Others disagreed . A letter on Sunday signed by 74 Republican members of the Florida House of Representatives urged Scott , also a Republican , to suspend Israel under a provision of the state constitution that lets the governor remove a sheriff for \" malfeasance , misfeasance , neglect of duty [ or ] incompetence . \" \" In the years leading up to this unspeakable tragedy , Sheriff Israel , his deputies and staff ignored repeated warning signs about the violent , erratic , threatening and antisocial behavior \" of the accused gunman , the letter said . It cited additional questions raised about the actions of the first deputies on the scene of the shooting . The Federal Bureau of Investigation also has drawn public outrage by acknowledging it failed to follow proper protocols after receiving a tip that Cruz possessed a gun , had indicated the desire to kill and could carry out a school shooting . FBI officials have told families of victims they \" deeply regret \" their mishandling of the matter . The carnage in Parkland , marking the second-deadliest U.S. public school shooting on record , has reignited an intense U.S. debate about firearms safety laws , with Stoneman Douglas students emerging as national voices calling for gun control .

		"paragraph": "It is believed that a 12-foot-6-inch alligator has killed a Florida woman after investigators found one of her arms inside the reptile . Shizuka Matsuki , 47 , of Plantation , Fla. , was walking her dogs on Friday in Davie , according to Officer Ronald Washington of the Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission , when the attack occurred . The FWC believes that the victim is deceased and we will continue recovery efforts on the lake with local authorities , an FWC statement read . Matsuki was walking with her dogs in Silver Lakes Rotary Nature Park when she vanished , according to police . A witness said they had seen her with her dogs earlier , but later that morning the dogs were barking near the water and she was gone . Davie Police Maj. Dale Engle said , Her dogs wo n t leave the pond . One of her dogs got bit by the gator . The police will remain on the site until her body is found . Florida developments encroach on wetlands and waterfronts . As a result , all 67 of Florida s counties have alligators , and people who live in the state can expect to see them . People are encouraged to report alligator concerns to a hotline , 866-392-4286 . While alligators are common in Florida and in the past 10 years the hotline has received 16,000 alligator complaints each year , attacks by an alligator are rare . According to the wildlife commission , there are about five unprovoked bites per year . Common advice from the wildlife commission is to keep pets away from edges of water and not swim with your dog , as they attract alligators . To avoid confrontation with an alligator , swim only in posted safe swimming areas during daylight hours . The FWC added , This tragedy is heartbreaking for everyone involved , and our sincere condolences go out to the family and friends of the victim at this time .

		"paragraph": "Ryan Fitzpatrick has gone into seasons as a starting quarterback and he s gone into seasons as a backup quarterback , but he d never gone into the season as a starter because the guy ahead of him on the depth chart has been suspended until this year . Jameis Winston ‘ s ban means Fitzpatrick is in line to start at least the first three games of the 2018 season for the Buccaneers . I mean , I thought I had seen and been through it all but another year , just another different situation , Fitzpatrick said , via the Tampa Bay Times . With games against the Saints , Eagles and Steelers on tap in the first three weeks , the Bucs will need to be sharp right out of the gate if they are going to avoid hamstringing themselves in the standings . Fitzpatrick said he is n t looking that far ahead , but will be counting on his teammates to help carry the load once they do get to the regular season . I mean , the season has n t even started yet , Fitzpatrick said . It s a clich . It s one game at a time but you have to look at it that way . Not even based off last year talent wise , looking at the team we have out here , I get in that huddle on offense and I mean , it s a pretty exciting huddle to be in as a quarterback looking at some of those guys . Fitzpatrick went 2-1 as a starter for Tampa last season . That was his 10th straight season making at least three starts in a season he also made three starts for the Rams in 2005 before that streak started and the Bucs are the seventh team that Fitzpatrick has started that many games for in a single season . None of that should have any bearing on how he fares this year , but it does support the notion that there is n t much Fitzpatrick has n t seen at this point of his career .",

		"paragraph": "Online dating can often feel like an endless series of lackluster dates . But what if a dating app could increase your odds of finding somebody you actually connect with ? That s what dating app Hinge is trying to accomplish with Most Compatible , a new , free feature rolling out Wednesday that recommends one highly compatible match every day a move that comes weeks after Match Group ( MTCH ) purchased a controlling stake in the app and two months after Facebook ( FB ) announced a dating feature of its own . Here s how it works : Hinge pairs you with another user it thinks you ll likely connect with , based on algorithms that suss out your previous actions on the app and your interests . So when you log onto Hinge each day , the first match that shows up in the app s Discover section will be your so-called Most Compatible match . Skeptical ? You have every right to be , given the glut of dating apps and services promising meaningful connections . But Hinge CEO Justin McLeod claims the app is onto something here . And while Hinge does n t disclose how many relationships have resulted from the app s test run of Most Compatible in Boston and Atlanta , he says that Hinge users are eight times more likely to go on dates with their Most Compatible matches . Translation : Hinge users are more likely to give their Most Compatible matches a shot . Most Compatible is really trying to figure out what type of person you re most likely to like and also most likely to like you , McLeod told Yahoo Finance . Hinge s latest feature comes on the heels of Match Group s purchase of a 51 % controlling stake in the app in June . It also comes over a year after the company moved away from the Tinder-like method of having users simply swipe left or right on matches to serving up somewhat deeper profiles with more photos and information about each user . The redesigned Hinge became known as the anti-Tinder . That s a reference to Match Group s fastest-growing dating app , which has a reputation of enabling hookups , or more casual , short-term connections . The cash infusion from Match Group s purchase is key to helping Hinge grow beyond the U.S. , UK , Canada , Australia and India . Indeed , McLeod expects Hinge to focus on further international expansion in 2019 . They [ Match Group ] have the resources , the know-how , and they ve done it with their other apps , McLeod explained of the move . It just made a lot of sense : if we wanted to bring a throughflow of people into the U.S. and the world , they were the best partner to do that . According to the terms of the agreement , Match Group has the right to purchase all the remaining shares of Hinge within the next 11 months or so a scenario McLeod tells Yahoo Finance is highly likely to happen . Hinge does not disclose how many users it has but claims its user base has grown 400 % since October 2016 , largely driven by word-of-mouth . But just as Hinge has seen a surge in users , the virtual dating space has also grown more crowded . At Facebook s F8 conference this May , the social network announced it planned on launching a dating feature of its own later this year on an undisclosed date news that initially sent Match Group s stock tumbling nearly 22 % . The stock has partly recovered in the weeks since . For his part , McLeod contends Hinge s users wo n t take a serious hit when Facebook Dating arrives , because 90 % of Hinge s users are between the ages of 23-36 some of whom use Facebook less than ever before . It s gratifying to have one of the world s biggest technology companies enter the dating space and draw so much inspiration from Hinge , but we do n t expect our target market to use Facebook for dating , he added . They re increasingly not using Facebook at all , which is why we recently released a way to log in to Hinge without Facebook . Be that as it may , Hinge will face stiff challenges as it inevitably branches out internationally into particular markets in parts of Asia , which already have local competitors vying for people s screentime . But with Match Group s cash and potentially more engaging features like Most Compatible Hinge is better armed to compete , at least .

		"paragraph": "UPDATED with video : Omarosa continued her march through NBC News programs this morning in support of her new book about her time in the White House , unveiling on Today show her December recording of President Donald Trump saying he did not know White House Chief of Staff Gen. John Kelly had fired her previous day . Omarosa , Omarosa what s going on ? I just saw in the news that you were thinking about leaving leaving . What happened ? someone sounding like Trump says in the recording Omarosa says she made the day after Kelly fired her from her position as White House director of communications in the office of public liaison , and had just heard about it in the news . General Kelly came to me and said that you guys wanted me to leave , O is heard responding . No . I had … nobody even told me about it . Nobody , Trump responds . You know , they run a big operation but I did n t know that . Dammit . I do n t love you leaving at all . NBC News does not know what was said before or after those comments in the recording , Savannah Guthrie made sure to tell viewers . Is he lying ? Guthrie asked of Trump s claim of ignorance . Omarosa wanted instead to talk about why she was stuck in the Situation Room for almost two hours and not allowed to leave , as Kelly was firing her and then turning her over to a team to walk through terms of her exit . She told Guthrie , as she had told Chuck Todd on Sunday Meet the Press that she had asked to leave and also asked to speak to her lawyer , and to her husband who she said was outside the room . On air , at least , no one from NBC News has asked Omarosa what her husband was doing outside the Situation Room . Omarosa also insisted Americans should be alarmed that the President of the United States is not aware of the employment status of a director of communications in the office of public liaison who first served him on The Apprentice 15 years ago . But Omarosa also told Guthrie she thinks Trump knew about her firing , saying he probably instructed Kelly to sack her so he could keep his hands clean when he spoke to me . So her comment is Gen. Kelly running this country or is the president running the country sounded more like bad script writing than ominous warning to the country . Omarosa also wanted America to know the White House still has personal stuff she had in her office and she wants it back . She also claimed White House had destroyed some of that stuff . She did not say what the stuff was , and Guthrie , who came prepared with a long list of questions , did not ask . Guthrie repeatedly tried to get Omarosa to stick the questions that were put to her , but O was having none of it , responding dismissively when Guthrie interrupted one of her meanderings , You ca n t ask a question and then ask another question without my answer . Omarosa wondered who is running the country when Donald Trump says ‘ they run a big operation . Is Kelly … running the country instead of the president ? Omarosa also mentioned it has been reported Trump lied about 4K times in the last year , and admitted she knew he was lying . Then why did you work for him ? Guthrie shot back . Savannah , slow down ! Omarosa responded condescendingly . I m going to answer your questions … . So you do n t have to ask 10 questions in one second . It s okay . That s known as running out the clock she had granted Today a 7 minute interview . Trump , she said , is known to be entertainer , to exaggerate . But I never expected him to lie to the country , Omarosa finally answered . I thought he would take his oath of office seriously , that he would be committed to advancing this country . He has an issue with the truth and sometimes he battles with reality , she asserted . Guthrie wondered how Omarosa allegedly taped Kelly in the Situation Room , firing her , given that it s one of the most secure places in the House House and you re supposed to leave your phone outside . It s the honor system Guthrie added , answering her own question . Omarosa , meanwhile , only said she would leave that to your imagination . Why be coy ? Guthrie asked . I m not being coy , Omarosa insisted stoutly in the face of fact . What does it say about Omarosa s integrity if she s taping Kelly in the Situation room and taping Trump etc. , Guthrie wondered out loud . Omarosa turned viewers attention to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders , who has called Unhinged , a pack of lies . She lies all the time , Omarosa scoffed . Clock ticking , Guthrie moved on to Omarosa s revelation to Todd on Sunday that she had actually heard the long-rumored tape of Trump allegedly using the N-word during production of the Apprentice franchise . O said what she heard was about three-minutes long , and is an audio tape . Guthrie asked another question about the content of the tape . I answered that question so what s the next question ? Omarosa sneered . The people who have this tape intend to release it , Omarosa promised us , suggesting a journalist ask Trump if he ever uttered that word . Book title refers to Trump , the author said when asked to clarify , explaining I do n t think he s fit and as you heard , he does n t even know what s happening in the White House . Kelly is running this White House and Trump does not know what is going on , Omarosa said , clearing up any uncertainty who she is really trying to take down .

		"paragraph": "Warning : Spoilers ahead for the Off Brand episode of Better Call Saul . Christmas in July ? How about Christmas in May , which is what this gem of an episode of Better Call Saul feels like : the first time we see Jimmy identify himself as Saul Goodman … Gus is checking out the industrial laundromat that will eventually become Walter White s underground meth lab … Chuck McGill is open to getting mental health help … and Lydia , one of the masterminds of Gus s international drug cartel , is introduced to the Saul universe in one of the biggest surprises of the season . With Season 3 officially more than halfway to the finale just four episodes remain Yahoo TV talked to series co-creator Peter Gould about the joys of star wipes , how Jimmy will spend his next year of non-lawyering ( after the bar hearing ended with a one-year suspension ) , what this means for Jimmy and Kim , the sincerity of Chuck s attempts to get control of his health , and how the guy we might have initially seen as the least trustworthy has turned out to be the only person Chuck trusts right now . We see Saul for the first time ! Yeah , definitely a version of Saul . At the beginning of the season , we talked about what we could say about the season and Bob [ Odenkirk ] said to someone , You re going to see Saul Goodman , but not how you expect necessarily . Instead of Saul Goodman the sleazy lawyer , we see Saul Goodman the wannabe television director . Whatever he is there at the end of the episode , he is certainly a new guy . And that guy says one of the funniest lines of the season . When Jimmy / Saul tells Kim the guy at the TV station said he s never seen so many star wipes in a row … it sums up what Jimmy would be as a filmmaker , I think , so well . He wants to say something is unique . That line , and I m so glad you like it , that came out of a suggestion of Bob s actually , because he mentioned to Ann Cherkis , the writer of the episode , after he read a draft , after any filmmaking project , the filmmaker will say , Nobody has ever done a steady-cam shot that goes underwater like this … [ everyone ] always has to try to say there is a first , so Ann dreamt up this line and decided it would be star wipes . Of course , when we posted the commercial , Kelley Dixon , our editor , had to go against her excellent good taste and add more star wipes … I think the largest number of star wipes I ve ever seen in a row , that s for sure . It hurt her to do it , though , I m sure . I m guessing she was holding her nose . She had a great sense of humor , and it s one of the joys of doing the show is that we re all building on each other s work , so it s really fun . The more serious part of that , though , and it s absolutely something you would assume that Jimmy would come up with , is that he finds this way to not only not lose out on his ad money , but he finds this new project for himself . There are so many times throughout the series when you think about Jimmy and just say , He could do anything . There are so many things he could be doing successfully with his skills , his personality , his intelligence . Sales and advertising absolutely seems like something that he would not only be great at , but that he would probably love doing , especially in this capacity . Obviously , we always have to keep in mind that we know where he ends up in the Breaking Bad universe , but is this year-long suspension from being a lawyer going to open up the possibility of him looking at other things that he would be happier doing , that he would be more successful doing even , if he were just free of Chuck and trying to live up to Chuck s expectations ? What a great question . Certainly , I do n t want to give anything away , but I ll speak for myself . We had two different reactions when we realized that Jimmy would be suspended for a year . One was joy , because it gives us so many possibilities , and like you say , Jimmy has so many abilities , and probably his greatest superpower is his ability to bounce back . When you knock him down , he pops back up , and there is something wonderful about that . He s so creative , and he has so much energy , it opens up a whole world to us . But it also means that for a year he s not going to be a lawyer , and that means that we have to do a lot of thinking . Jimmy does , too , because even though he s not going to be a lawyer for a year , he has this office with Kim , and that seems to be really central to him . We found out way back in Season 1 that having an office with Kim and being next to her , being with her , is one of the most important things in his life . If he s not going to be a lawyer , as we find out in this episode , what is going to happen to that office ? Jimmy is deeply determined and almost energized because he does not want to lose what he gained last season . He does not want to lose that relationship with Kim . He does not want to lose that feeling that he s got . For whatever reason , being side by side with her … I do n t think I m giving anything away when I say he loves her , and we ve realized as we ve gone forward that she may be the love of his life . He feels that this office is something that is very important , that they ve built together . How far is he going to go to defend that is one of the questions we asked ourselves . That brings up another charming thing about Jimmy : He s not really thinking about money and never really has in terms of , as Jimmy anyway , accumulating it . It s what it can do for him . Right now , as you said , his main concern really is being able to keep that office and stay with Kim . He does n t care that he does n t have the Davis & Main car and all those things anymore . He just , right now , needs to make enough money to keep that office going . I think he would live there as long as it meant he could stay with Kim . I think you re right . We have an interesting thing about our show … Jimmy and Mike both , we have two people who are on the edge of criminality , but neither one seems to care all that much about money by itself . Neither one of them is a classically greedy person . Jimmy may be greedy for attention , but that is a little bit different . I agree with you . I find that fascinating . It often causes us all kinds of … I do n t want to say it causes us problems , but it makes us think more deeply about the characters , to think about what motivates them and why they take the steps that they do . And that s one of the things I find fascinating about Mike as well as Jimmy . Mike , we meet on Breaking Bad and he s living in that same little house , the same one that he is apparently able to rent or own with his income from retirement as a police officer and working in a parking booth . He has n t really changed his lifestyle when he [ becomes ] right-hand man to a drug lord . You know that something else is motivating him , and one of the fascinating things that we re exploring on the show is , of course , how Mike Ehrmantraut becomes Gus Fring s right-hand man . There are a couple of other big things that happen . Gus … Lydia … we see him checking out the industrial laundry facility for the first time . This episode is packed with these monumental Saul/Breaking Bad universe events . Who expected to see Lydia at this point ? Yeah . And we get to see the chicken farm and Lydia in one long sequence , and the laundry , too . It was so much fun for us to bring back Laura Fraser . Vince [ Gilligan ] and I called her at home in Scotland to explain what we were hoping for , and of course , Laura is a wonderful actress , and she also has the most beautiful Scottish accent when she is speaking as Laura Fraser before she transforms herself into Lydia . She is a find , and I think there is so much more to say about Lydia Rodarte . I m fascinated by seeing her also with Gus , and when we knew her on Breaking Bad … we never met her until after Gus was dead , and the whole operation was in terrible danger . Now we re seeing her a little bit more optimistic about how this whole venture is going to go . She is obviously aiding and abetting Gus in buying this laundry facility . Of course , it is another wonderful moment if you caught it … Giancarlo [ Esposito ] was actually shining a flashlight underneath the washing machines , which later on Breaking Bad , of course , is moved to reveal the secret stairway that will take them down to the super lab . He is already scouting out where he s going to put that lab , so he s got a plan . That s for sure . We re really seeing the very beginning of that whole huge , international operation at this point . Yes , we are . We were talking earlier about Jimmy and his affection for Kim . I love the scene where they re celebrating their bar hearing victory . You and I have talked about this before … their romance is a very classic , old movie romance , and this is a small glimpse into the more physical romance . She has her feet crossed over his . She s leaning her head on this shoulder . She cups his face with her hand . He makes that joke about rolling around on the floor on her notes . It s fun to get that from them , right after she has given this summation that really does highlight all the wonderful parts of Jimmy , how caring he is , especially for people who are underserved or neglected . Was it intentional to give us that little moment when we know that things are probably going to go wrong again soon ? Absolutely . Kim really has thrown her lot in with Jimmy , and she does not lie in that hearing . But she knows that there are omissions , and she also knows , even though Chuck was angry and losing his temper and motivated by all kinds of terrible things … a lot of what Chuck said was true , and she knows it . She knows it damn well . Kim has thrown her lot in with Jimmy , and it really seems like the reason for that is that she cares for him deeply , but she cares for him enough that she has compromised herself in a way . Like you , I love seeing these two together . Bob and Rhea [ Seehorn ] have such chemistry together . There s such a playfulness and a knowingness to how they treat each other that I find fascinating . I ca n t take my eyes off them . I m so glad you agree . Of course , the better the romance goes , the more concerned I get , because we all have a feeling that this may not end well . We did n t see Kim Wexler on Breaking Bad . Even if she exists in Breaking Bad , it s very hard to imagine Kim Wexler being Saul Goodman s girlfriend . Just as Jimmy is trying to make a move forward during his suspension , it appears Chuck also is . It looks like he s going out to try to get help , like he really listened to what Howard was telling him . There s still some humor , of course . When he goes out to use the pay phone , he is like a Mylar-covered Rocky Balboa heading off to battle . But he does seem to be sincere in seeking out help right now . That s right . I m so glad you brought that up because , for us … and I love the way Michael McKean plays this character . It s astounding . That scene is a particular favorite of mine , because it is Chuck s hero s journey . He is going out into the world of electricity , and he is also going out in public with a space blanket over his head , which ca n t be easy for a man with so much pride . He is doing it to call the doctor . I love the way [ director ] Keith Gordon shot that scene . It s also a scene that Marshall Adams , our [ director of photography ] , shot in a different way . One of the things I m so proud of is that we have a man who has an allergy to electricity , and each one of the directors on the show has found a different way to communicate what it feels like to be Chuck . Earlier in the season , Dan Sackheim , in episode 5 , he actually used 35 mm film hand cranked and superimposed to communicate this . Here , Keith Gordon used heightened colors and heightened sounds to communicate this . It s a wonderful thing when you get to see these creative artists find different ways of communicating what it feels to be like Chuck McGill . It s so bright and colorful , and it really does give you a different feeling for Chuck , more empathy about just how intrusive and intense this condition must feel to him . Yes . Of course , Michael McKean is wonderful . You ll see more wonderful coming up from him , too . Howard is another standout in this episode . Throughout the series , he is someone who … viewers instincts may have been to write him off as this jerky , snooty , corporate guy , but we ve really gotten to see different pictures of him , different layers of him . When he goes to Chuck s house to deliver the news of the results of the hearing , he goes there with that $ 3,000 - $ 4,000 bottle of liquor . He has his own agendas , of course , and has to as the head of the law firm , but we really have come to see that he has some heart . He has some compassion for Chuck , for sure , some empathy for him . Again , he would do better if Chuck could get himself together and come back to the firm , but Howard seems to be sincere also in trying to get Chuck back on track with his whole life . I am beside myself that you bring this up because we grew to like Howard , and Patrick Fabian is doing such a spectacular job this season . In the editing room , the editors frequently say , Man , he is just great . And we ll sit there and watch so many things that he does to bring three dimensions to this character who , as you say , when we first met him at the beginning of Season 1 , seemed like just a stuffed shirt in contrast to Jimmy . Now we see that he does care for Chuck , but he s also depending on Chuck in some ways . They are law partners . He warned Chuck , really , in [ Chicanery ] , more or less warned Chuck not to take the stand it was unnecessary , and Chuck ignored him . Now he is giving Chuck some more good advice , and we ll see if Chuck is able to take it . I think it s revealing that Chuck wo n t allow Rebecca in the house , but Howard does get into the house . I think that Howard seems to be the one person who Chuck allows himself to show a tiny bit of vulnerability to . Just the littlest , tiny molecule of vulnerability . Watching these two together , [ McKean and Fabian ] really is a master class . They are wonderful . Also , Patrick is also just the nicest guy in the world , which , of course , really makes it a pleasure to work with him . Better Call Saul airs Mondays at 10 p.m. on AMC .

		"paragraph": "SPOILER ALERT : The recap for the Swear episode of The Walking Dead contains storyline and character spoilers . There s good news , and terrible , horrible , no good , very bad news in this sixth episode of The Walking Dead Season 7 : We finally catch up with Tara and Heath hooray but we also learn that Negan and the Saviors are not only way more brutal than we thought , there are also way more of them than we thought . We re Supposed To A young girl named Rachel is quite enthusiastic about stabbing a bloated walker she and an older girl named Cyndie find near the beach . Rachel spots another body on the beach and runs off to make her next kill , but Cyndie yells for her to stop , just before she stabs a woman Tara ! in the head . Tara s still alive , but unconscious , Cyndie points out . We still got ta do it , Rachel insists , but Cyndie says they do n t , not if people do n t find out . Rachel says she s not a snitch , but she s ticked off about not getting to make another kill , so she says she wo n t help Cyndie , either . Cyndie drags Tara s body to a secluded spot on the beach and brings her bottles of water , something wrapped in a cloth , and a spear . When Cyndie walks away , Tara opens her eyes and downs the water . She unwraps the cloth to find a dried fish , and when she spots Cyndie leaving the beach , she grabs the spear and follows her . You Choose You Heath and Tara are still on their supply run in the RV , and Heath is dejected about the fruits of their labor for the last two weeks : eight rusty cans of okra and a bottle of aspirin . Rule No. 1 of scavenging is , there s nothing left in this world that is n t hidden , Tara tries to reassure him . We just have to find it . He s also still wigged out about the attack on the Saviors outpost , and the realization it forced him to make about just how dangerous the world , and people , are outside the walls of Alexandria . If it s you or someone else , you choose you , Heath says , but Tara does n t believe he really means that . They move on to a new location to look for supplies and happen upon a bridge that s been barricaded on one side . It s littered with cars and tents and tarps strung up on wire and a kiddie pool with dead plants in it , as if a group of people had tried to carry out a plan . Heath and Tara spot a giant mountain of sand on the bridge , and just as Heath sees a big pile of spent bullet casings at the bottom of it , Tara pulls something out of the pile that sends the whole thing raining down on them . It also frees dozens of walkers , who are now trying to snack on them . Very quickly , they re each surrounded by walkers , and Heath disappears behind a tarp . Did he really choose you and abandon Tara , who is now being backed into the edge of the bridge by walkers ? As she yells out for her friend , she tumbles over the side of the bridge and into the river below . Where Are All the Men ? Back at the beach , Tara has followed Cyndie through a woodsy area and into a little gathering of cottages . She sees women carrying baskets , kids playing , lookouts on platforms , and things covered in camouflage material . Everyone , mostly adult women , is mostly dressed in drab browns and dark greens , and Tara sees they also have a large storage shed packed with guns of all sizes . Before she can understand what is happening , the women run for the artillery shed and pick up guns , and the first shots are fired at Tara . Luckily for her , they re all pretty terrible shots , and she runs away from them and into a woman with a gun . Tara knocks her down , takes her gun , but does n t shoot her . She runs off again , but this time runs straight into Rachel , the kill-happy tween , who s pointing a gun right at her . Tara drops her spear , but Rachel says , Does n t matter , we re supposed to . Cyndie comes to the rescue again to spare Tara s life , but the whole community of nearly all women has gathered around her , all pointing guns at her . The group s leader , an older woman we ll soon meet as Natania , is listening as Tara tries to explain she meant no harm and will happily be on her way , but the next time we see her , she s handcuffed to a radiator inside an office with a picture on the wall that indicates she s at the Oceanside Cabin Motor Court . Natania , Kathy , and Beatrice ( the woman Tara chose not to shoot earlier ) talk to her , revealing they have a system of bells and air horns they use to keep their hidden community safe . Tara tells them she fell off a bridge , into a river , which carried her to the ocean and the beach . Natania tells her they usually shoot people on sight to further insure their safety , but they paused with her because Cyndie , Natania s granddaughter , likes her , and because she spared Beatrice s life . But if they let her go , they have no guarantee she wo n t run and tell other people about their community . Yeah , that s a pickle all right , Tara replies . Related : ‘ The Walking Dead Star Sonequa Martin-Green Says the Women Want to ‘ Rectify This Wrong That night , Kathy gets Tara from the Oceanside office , and leads her through the woods to another cabin . The table is set for dinner , and Natania asks her if she likes fish , because fish stew is what s on the menu . The table includes Natania , Tara , Beatrice , Kathy , and Cyndie , who explains Rachel to Tara , saying she s never had to kill a living human yet . Cyndie has , and she s a good shot . Dinner begins , and Tara scarfs down the meal so quickly that Kathy asks when she last ate . Natania talks about their endless supply of fish being a perk of living near the ocean and she asks Tara if she d like to stay with them , permanently . Tara could put down roots , she says , and they d be sure their community remains a secret . Tara had told them she s been living in random places since the apocalypse began and that she traveled with a friend , so Natania offers to help find him and let him move into the community too . That prompts a question . I never thought I d be asking this , but where are all the men ? Tara asks , and when all the women bow their heads , she continues , All of them ? Natania explains they got into a skirmish with another group of survivors , and they lost all their men , as well as Cyndie s mom and 11-year-old brother . After that , we decided to protect ourselves no matter what , Natania says . No matter who we crossed , we would kill on sight . We left our old home with just the clothes on our backs . And then we found this place . We would stay hidden . And we would stay alive . She goes on to say she knows Tara probably thinks they re monsters , but she hopes their honesty will spark Tara to be honest with them . She had previously also told them she worked on a fishing boat , which they knew was a lie . So she comes clean about living in a community , with walls , where she has a girlfriend that she s anxious to return to . ( Oh , no , we forgot … she does n t know about Denise , or Glenn , or Abraham ) . She tells them , without sharing the name of the group , that her people have also done things to survive , taking out a whole group of survivors who lived at a satellite station . The look that passes among the other women suggests they know exactly who she s talking about . Tara suggests the Oceanside community could team up with her community , an idea that s immediately shot down . Tara tells them they ca n t go on forever assuming everyone is their enemy . Sooner or later , you re gon na need a friend , she tells them . Cyndie tries to agree with Tara , but her grandmother cuts her off . All Natania will agree to is sending someone with Tara to find Heath and continue on to her community to scope it out . The next day , Tara leaves , with Beatrice and Kathy , to head back to the bridge where she last saw Heath . People getting together … that s how the world s gon na be the world again , Tara says to Natania on her way out . But the trip turns deadly , quickly , as the women lead Tara through the woods and start shooting at her . She runs away , but Beatrice catches up with her and points her gun right at Tara , tearfully telling her she has nothing left , that the group her friends attacked , the Saviors , have already killed them . Tara says no , her people killed the entire outpost , but Beatrice says there are more Saviors and more outposts . She tells Tara they ca n t be stopped they lined up all the men and all the boys who were older than 10 and shot them in the head . And we tried to fight , just like you , Beatrice says . They won . Finally , one night the women and children still alive left , running away to the eventual safety of Oceanside . We are not gon na let you lead them back to us , Beatrice tells Tara , just as she s about to kill her . Cyndie interrupts to save Tara s life for a third time , and she gives her a backpack of food and water , and a spear , and says she ll lead her back to the bridge . They get there , and Cyndie stays to help Tara survive the walkers and get to the other end of the bridge . Just as Tara makes it , she looks back to see Kathy and Beatrice have arrived to drag Cyndie back home . Tara then remembers what really happened at the bridge before her trip down the river to Oceanside . Heath had briefly disappeared behind a tarp , but came right back to help her out of her walker jam . She yells to him that she s coming to help him he s surrounded by them too and then she tells him they re in this together . I know , he yells , before she goes into the water . Now back at the scene , Tara walks along the road and spots Heath s broken glasses on the ground . Next to them , she sees there are what looks like fresh tire tracks in the grass . Maybe that was you , she mumbles . Then she spots something in the grass , a white security badge or pass with the letters PPP written on it . I hope that was you , she says . We Can Square This Tara heads towards home , walking through fields , and seeking temporary refuge in an old boat and in a gift shop . She eats more of that salted dry perch Cyndie packed into the go bag for her , and finds that her new friend also included a present : a bracelet made of seashells . Finally , Tara is walking down the road just outside the Alexandria gates , smiling , wearing a pair of bright sunglasses she got at the gift shop . Eugene spots her through binoculars , and by the time he opens the gates to greet her , he s crying , as the bearer of so much heartbreaking news . Sitting on the floor in Denise s medical office , Tara is playing with a doctor bobblehead when Rosita tells her she s sorry . Tara tells her the same thing , and then an angry Rosita tells her they do n t have to just sit there . She wants to square things , and she wonders if Tara has any leads on where they can replenish their gun supply . She does n t care how dangerous the acquisition would be , Rosita says . We can make this right . We have to . We ca n t , Tara answers . I did n t see anything like that out there . Zombie Bites : * In TWD comics , there s a group of survivors who live near the beach in Virginia , and their community is referred to as Oceanside . Readers have yet to see the community or its residents , and they re introduced in issue 139 ( the most recent issue released is 160 ) , which puts them at a different point in the comic s timeline than we re currently at in the show ( not that that means anything … mashups ) . What we do know is that , as Natania and her people do , the Oceansiders in the comics also live off the ocean , and they eventually become a part of the trading system that includes Alexandria , the Hilltop , the Kingdom , and the Sanctuary . * Nobody s evil , they just decide to forget who they are , Cyndie tells Tara , who assures her , Some people are evil , Cyndie . I ve seen it . * That instrumental song playing as Tara makes her way back to Alexandria : Dirty Three s Everything s F ***** . Sounds about right . * The Oceanside crew refers to walkers as bobbers . * Is Heath dead or alive ? Those tire tracks near his broken glasses suggest he might have been taken , but ultimately , the answer to his fate might be tied to actor Corey Hawkins s availability and the success of the 24 : Legacy reboot he s starring in on Fox in February . * Natania tells Tara she and her people fled from the Saviors with nothing but the clothes on their backs . So how and where did they get that big cache of guns ? OK , Dead-heads , let s hear your reactions to Swear . Our questions : Why did n t Tara tell Rosita about the Oceanside community and their big supply of guns ? Is she trying to protect the Oceanside women , or protect Rosita from making a dangerous mission to procure those weapons for Alexandria ? How long do you think it ll be until we inevitably see those Oceanside women again ? Were you surprised about this new intel on just how widespread the Saviors murderous ways are ? And what do you think happened to Heath ? The Walking Dead airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on AMC .",

		"paragraph": "( Bloomberg ) -- Israeli aircraft struck dozens of targets across the Gaza Strip overnight following rocket barrages on southern Israel . The flare in violence , which caused no serious casualties , followed another deadly confrontation Friday during Palestinian protests along the Gaza-Israel border . Health officials in Hamas-ruled Gaza reported that Israeli troops killed five Palestinians , and a sixth died while making a homemade bomb . The Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility for the rocket attacks , saying they were in response to the deaths on Friday . Around midday , it said in a statement that it had agreed at Egypt s behest to cease fire and keep the situation from deteriorating further . The Israeli military said it viewed the rocket assault severely and held Hamas responsible for anything that happens in the enclave . It accused the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Iran s Al - Quds Force of being behind the bombardments . Rockets Intercepted More than 30 launches were identified from Gaza beginning late Friday , the Israeli military said , and about a dozen were intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system . Israeli aircraft struck around 95 sites , including weapons manufacturing facilities and military compounds including Hamas s security services headquarters , it said . Other targets included the entrance to a tunnel dug to infiltrate and attack Israel , and an anti-aircraft observation post , it said . Gaza Health Ministry official Ashra al-Qedra said an airstrike on northern Gaza leveled an empty four-story building . A hospital near one of the targets was slightly damaged , he said . Confrontations between Gaza and Israel began escalating in late March after Palestinians launched a campaign of weekly Friday protests against Israel . Israeli snipers deployed on the border have killed more than 210 Palestinians , and one Israeli soldier was killed by sniper fire from Gaza . The Gaza protest campaign has included frequent attempts to cut through the 10-foot-high ( 3-meter ) wire border fence to enter Israel . Gazans have also sent flaming balloons and kites over the border , setting fire to thousands of acres of forest and agricultural land .

		"paragraph": "PARK CITY , Utah ( AP ) He once called Donald Trump \" a con man , \" but Mitt Romney now predicts that Trump would \" easily \" win his party 's presidential nomination in 2020 and \" solidly \" win a second term . Romney , the GOP 's failed 2012 presidential nominee from Massachusetts , now a Republican Senate candidate in Utah , made the prediction Thursday as he welcomed dozens of high-profile business and political leaders to a mountainside retreat in Utah Thursday night . As he has every year since 2012 , Romney played host to an invitation-only summit focused on the future of American leadership at home and abroad . The future , he predicted , would feature Trump as America 's leader at least for another six years . \" I think that not just because of the strong economy and the fact that people are going to see increasingly rising wages , \" Romney said , \" but I think it 's also true because I think our Democrat friends are likely to nominate someone who is really out of the mainstream of American thought and will make it easier for a president who 's presiding over a growing economy . \" The remarks from Romney marked a sharp reversal from his original impression of Trump . Romney briefly served as the face of the so-called \" Never Trump \" movement before the 2016 election . He delivered a scathing speech in Utah before the 2016 election , calling Trump \" a con man \" and \" a fake . \" Yet Romney 's criticism has softened since then . And now , in the midst of a Republican Senate primary campaign , the former Massachusetts governor appears to be embracing Trump and his leadership role in the modern-day Republican Party . He delivered the remarks on the first day of a three-day , closed-door summit in Utah 's mountains . The Associated Press was allowed to listen to Romney 's remarks during the event 's opening reception . Dignitaries on the guest list feature included House Speaker Paul Ryan , billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , and Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner in addition to actor Seth Rogin , former Starbuck CEO Howard Schultz and former Domino 's Pizza CEO Patrick Doyle . While there were many Trump skeptics in the crowd , a handful of Trump loyalists were in attendance as well , including short-lived White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci and Blackrock CEO Stephen Schwarzman . It wo n't be all business . Guests will have an opportunity to go skeet shooting with Ryan or hiking with Romney . \" I 'm looking forward to an unusual and packed couple of days here , \" Romney said , suggesting he would have little more to say about politics . \" Campaigns are off limits . \"",

		"paragraph": "Over the weekend , I entered the word how into my browser , and the top searches auto-populated as below : ( Not going to admit what I was actually searching ! ) Clearly , the Latin lover is highly desirable . As one myself , I can attest to that . So why have I never given it a try ? Let s get simple facts out of the way first . I was raised in a predominately white town the only Latinos I saw were my family members . So sheer numbers ( i.e. , lack of opportunity ) played an important role . The reason for not dating them after leaving said town at 18 years old is a stickier subject . The psychology behind my subconscious strategy began early , as all our most limiting narratives do . I remember playing on the playground in kindergarten with Michael Allen , my very first crush . Michael was adorable blue-eyed and towheaded . I was head-over-baby-heels ! He seemed to return my feelings until one day he asked me , Are you black ? and ran away . I had no idea what this meant at the time , except that I was clearly different , and it seemed the difference ( according to him ) was a negative one . Call me crazy , but that kind of stuck ! And the trauma was reinforced as it repeated throughout grammar , middle , and high school in various circumstances and intensified degrees . Chief among them was my relationship with my very first boyfriend , Brett . I was 17 years old my parents were splitting up my sister , the closest person in my life , had gone away to college and I was being bullied at school in a big way . I was feeling isolated and scared when I found myself in detention ( for being persistently tardy ) , and there he was . Brett had expressed interest in me for many years , but I never returned the feelings . Until now . Simultaneously , demographics were changing in town . At this time , the area experienced a surge of Latino immigrants looking for work in the affluent town . They found it readily at the strip mall , various local restaurants , and in childcare and landscaping . As immigration became more prevalent , so did the resistance to it . Our new residents were different in a particular way they were brown , which was the easiest thing to identify and , in turn , attach prejudices to . In school , the term dirty Mexican became a very common insult , and the link to me was made immediately . Not only did I look like these immigrants , but I spoke the language and lived on the very edge of town , Selma Boulevard , a street known to offer more affordable housing . I was suddenly viewed as different from the same kids I d grown up alongside since pre-K . It felt as if they had suddenly discovered a dirty little secret about me . ‘ Now they understood . And while I would go after any peer who made a disparaging or racist remark , I submissively swallowed my boyfriend s and his family s racism daily . The racism was subtle at first , but progressed as it became clear my relationship with Brett could be more than just a high school crush . I can recall Brett s dad , Robert , bragging to us one day that he had picked up a local Mexican in town and given him a pitiful amount of money to manicure their incredibly extensive property . He stared curiously for my reaction . My father was a tree surgeon , a fact Robert knew , and often took jobs on the weekends , such as the one he was describing to us . I felt rage at Robert , at myself but I was frozen . I felt like a mouse in a cage . I knew I should run , but something made me feel as if I should prove my worth to this depraved family . Something about their degrading treatment felt familiar to me , and so I stayed . But the family s objection to the relationship never ceased , and I was eventually forbidden to visit the house . Brett did not break up with me though . Our hormonal codependency was enough to sustain the persistent attacks from his family and even our peers . The reaction to our coupling in school was that I was a gold digger . I m at a loss for a response there , even after 15 years . Meanwhile , Brett was unfazed . He seemed to congratulate himself on his exotic tastes in the same way he did his horribly ostentatious cars . ( He drove a white Hummer and a black Corvette that you could hear coming from the moon , approximately 1.2 miles to school every day . ) I was n t sure what to make of this , but I felt safer having him on my side . It touched me that he stood up to his parents , and I felt insulated from the bullies at school even though he was the biggest bully of all . To me Brett , his family , and my peers confirmed the complejo ( the Spanish word for complex ) that began that day in kindergarten with Michael Allen . And while we all have those coming-of-age experiences where we feel we do not fit in , mine was attached to my ethnicity , the color of my skin , my unique features , and the people I love most my family . The experience was quite painful and birthed in me a cover-up hiding aspects of my personality I felt could isolate me from my white peers and a constant seeking of approval from white men ( and white women really ) . Their stamp of approval was the hall pass I needed . Water me down with your whiteness , my subconscious cried . And I was willing to be eroticized for my spiciness ( Brett literally called me spicy as a compliment ) if it meant he could help me blend in . I realized I wanted Brett s love ( i.e. , his choosing to be in a relationship with me over the white girls ) to prove I was attractive and desirable that even if I was different , I was still OK . And as long as he did n t run away ( the way Michael Allen did ) , even if the relationship was torture , it meant I was lovable despite my brownness . A white man choosing a brown girl was the ultimate approval , and therefore my subconscious goal into adulthood . Even after moving away from small towns and small minds , I could feel the trigger activated most especially in my love life . As anyone could predict , my issues manifested as follows : I ve clocked a solid 18 years in long-term relationships . Four boyfriends all white men and two from my hometown . ( Yup , I m a glutton for punishment ! ) I recently became aware of my pattern when my most recent crush stopped me dead in my tracks . I first met him , let s call him Bill , in a job interview where he barely looked at or spoke to me . In spite of that , Bill soon became my boss . He was blue-eyed and towheaded . Sound familiar ? We became fast friends and developed a trustworthy business relationship . I believed him to be a great guy , which he is . I d invent reasons to speak to Bill in order to suss out why he was clearly going to be my future husband . Conveniently the most terrifying political election in history was going down , but he had no interest in discussing . He lived blocks from the Trump building and yet was somehow completely oblivious to the historic Women s March . In fact , he told me that while he understood his position of privilege as a white man , people s passionate views on today s tumultuous climate made him highly uncomfortable , and he preferred not to engage . Meanwhile , I was visibly crying at the office the day Trump was elected and proudly shouting LOVE TRUMPS HATE whilst wielding a Planned Parenthood sign at the march . I was turned off by his entitled apathy , but with my historic trigger activated , I had to make my fantasy about Bill a reality in order to feel OK . It was the first time I became aware of what I was doing . Bill was simply being himself and a savvy businessman , which is not wrong . But I was deciding I liked him based not on what was actually being presented but on what I subconsciously needed , which was to have this white man approve of me by agreeing with my politics . If he agreed , then I would obvs marry him . Duh . The truth is : Sure , he was handsome , driven , and polite , but it was clear our core values did not resonate . I dreaded my crush on that day and was proud of myself for making major progress . Today I m dating . I m aware of my subconscious patterning , and I can see when I move toward old habits . When I do , I try to remind myself that was then and this is now . I was a little girl trying to fit in , and I did n t know any better . But I ve always been a ferociously proud Latina . I honor my heritage and my parents heroic stories of overcoming great odds to achieve the American dream . I love my unique features being bilingual and I want to continue those traditions with my own family one day . Does this mean I must finally find my Latin lover ? I do n t know . But I m more open than ever . I never felt my pattern caused me to turn away from Latin men . It just kept me on a hamster wheel using one archetype as a tool for self-harm cementing an insecurity from my childhood . And now I can move toward a man , of any race or ethnicity , who embraces all of me .

She 's going to stay in King 's Landing and help her son , Tommen . When Tywin scoffs at her demands , she issues the ultimate threat to tell the truth about his parentage . Oh yes , Cersei finally forces Tywin to acknowledge that his children have been committing incest all these years ! \" Your legacy is a lie , \" she hisses . Then she strides into Jaime 's room , where she declares that he and Tommen are the only people she cares about . Now that Tywin knows , she does n't care who else whispers about their relationship .

Before Tyrion flees for good , he makes one last stop at his father 's rooms . There , he 's shocked to find Shae in Tywin 's bed . Oh , snap ! She even murmurs , \" my lion , \" thinking it 's Tywin . It 's a stunning betrayal . Shae sees him and grabs a knife to slash at Tyrion , and with tears in his eyes , he ends up choking her to death . Tyrion grabs a crossbolt and goes looking for his father , who 's sitting on the toilet in the bathroom . \" All my life , you 've wanted me dead , \" Tyrion says sadly . At first , the Lannister patriarch tries to talk his way out of the situation , calling Tyrion his son and showering him with compliments about his toughness . But when Tywin calls Shae a whore one too many times , Tyrion shoots him in the chest . Then he reloads and shoots him again . The silver-tongued Tyrion , for once , has no words as he shows up to meet Varys , who puts him in a crate . That crate is loaded onto a ship . As the bells toll in King 's Landing , indicating Tywin 's death , crafty Varys gets on the ship himself . Wherever these two clever men are going , at least they 'll make one hell of a team .

Was n't he in Braavos , like , three seconds ago ? Clearly , he got the money he asked for , and hired the soldiers he wanted . Guess he took that message from Commander Mormont seriously , because he 's shown up at the Wall to take charge . Jon introduces himself as Ned Stark 's son and suggests they take Mance prisoner instead of killing him .

The company is teasing the change on social media by holding polls that allow people to guess what the b stands for . Choices include biscuits , bacon , butternut squash and barnacles .

The 22-year-old Sheffield was 6-4 with a 2.56 ERA in 15 starts and five relief appearances for Triple-A Scranton Wilkes/Barre this year after going 1-2 with a 2.25 ERA in five starts for Double-A Trenton .

'' I know that early on it was kind of rocky just because getting the routine down was a little hard , '' Sheffield said of the bullpen move . '' But I 'm feeling comfortable . '' Sheffield was selected by Cleveland with the 31st overall pick in the 2014 amateur draft and was acquired by the Yankees in the July 2016 trade that sent left-hander Andrew Miller to the Indians .

'' He 's not built up like he was a starter for most of the season , but he 's still a guy that we feel like could give us a couple of innings if we needed it . '' Outfielder Clint Frazier , also obtained by New York in that trade , was transferred to the 60-day disabled list to open a spot for Sheffield , whose contract was selected to the 40-man roster .

In recent footage obtained by ET , Goodman was at an auto repair shop in New Orleans where he was collecting his car after repairs . The actor was reluctant to address the drama , explaining that he would \" rather say nothing than to cause more trouble . \" However , the 65-year-old actor -- who played Roseanne Barr 's on-screen husband , Dan Conner , on the ABC sitcom -- assured fans that he 's doing OK amid the controversy , sharing , \" Everything 's fine . \" The actor also seemed pretty content with ABC deciding to suspend its Emmys For Your Consideration campaign for the show s recent 10th season , which means that none of the cast or creators would likely see any love from this year 's Emmy Awards . \" I was n't gon na get an Emmy anyway , \" Goodman said , shrugging . \" I 've been up there [ 11 ] times already , and if I did n't get one I 'm not gon na get one . \" Goodman was nominated for 11 Emmys between 1988 and 2010 -- six of which were for his role on Roseanne . Goodman did take home one Emmy in 2007 for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his role on the short-lived series Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip . The sitcom also earned the veteran TV star five Golden Globe nominations , of which he won once , in 1993 . Goodman said he has n't been following the news of the developing controversy regarding Roseanne , stating , \" I do n't know anything about it . I do n't read it . \" That includes rumors and speculation that the show could possibly continue in the future in the form of a spin-off , if Barr 's titular character was written off , and the focus was shifted to Goodman 's character . The actor said of the rumors , \" Then you 've heard more than I have . \" The long , contentious drama between Barr and ABC began early Tuesday morning when the 65-year-old actress posted a racist tweet regarding former White House adviser Valerie Jarrett , which she then deleted . Later Tuesday morning , ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey released a statement announcing that the network had cancelled Roseanne in response to the outrage surrounding Barr 's remark . ABC subsequently removed all references to the revival series on its press site and Viacom pulled all re-runs of the sitcom 's entire run from all of its channels . Barr declared that she was going to leave Twitter on Tuesday morning , only to return in the evening with a late-night tweet storm that blamed her original offending tweet on Ambien , and then called out several of her co-stars for throwing her \" under the bus . \" For more on the on-going controversy -- including the fallout Barr is facing for her comments -- check out the video below .

		"paragraph": "Model Kate Upton is further explaining the sexual harassment allegations she made towards Guess co-founder Paul Marciano , saying , I m not going to let him intimidate me anymore . Upton first made the claims in a Jan. 31 tweet that read , It s disappointing that such an iconic women s brand @Guess is still empowering Paul Marciano as their creative director #metoo . She also shared the same message on Instagram , writing , He should n t be allowed to use his power in the industry to sexually and emotionally harass women #metoo . After Upton s disclosures , Marciano sent a statement to TMZ , saying in part , This accusation is false . I have never touched Kate Upton . I have never been alone with Kate Upton . I have never acted inappropriately towards her . On Wednesday , the 25-year-old model gave a powerful interview to Time , revealing abusive treatment from the fashion mogul , starting from when she was 18 . In a statement to Time , however , Marciano denied the allegations . I have never been alone with Kate Upton , he said . I have never touched her inappropriately . Nor would I ever refer to a Guess model in such a derogatory manner . Marciano added , I fully support the #MeToo movement . At the same time , I will not allow others to defame me and tarnish my reputation . I have pledged to Guess and its board of directors my full support and cooperation with a fair and impartial investigation . In the Time interview , Upton described her first day of work in July 2010 for a Guess lingerie campaign . Paul Marciano said he wanted to meet with me , she said . As soon as I walked in with photographer Yu Tsai , Paul came straight up to me , forcibly grabbed my breasts and started feeling them playing with them , actually . After I pushed him away , he said , ‘ I m making sure they re real . Upton continued , Despite doing everything I could physically do to avoid his touch throughout the meeting , he continued to touch me in a very dominating and aggressive way , grabbing my thighs , my arms to pull me closer , my shoulders to pull me closer , my neck , my breasts , and smelling me . He then told Yu Tsai to leave us alone . I was able to send a quick text to Yu Tsai asking him to stay . He did , but that did not stop Paul s constant grabbing . I was extremely shaken , surprised , and scared . At one point he forcibly grabbed the back of my head so that I could not move and started kissing my face and my neck . I remember not wanting to say ‘ Get off of me because I did n t want to open my mouth to say anything because I did n t want him to be able to put his tongue in my mouth . I had two options : Do everything I could to wiggle away and avoid his pursuit , or punch the CEO of Guess . So I decided to just wiggle away . Upton described how Marciano insisted on walking her to her hotel room , but the photographer intervened . I was so relieved and felt like I had barely escaped , she said . One month later , Upton accepted another Guess shoot and once in her hotel room , she says Marciano called several times asking to visit . After several denials , I just turned off my phone and locked the door and tried to get some sleep , she said . I was terrified . All I could think was if he was able to get into my room it would not be good . The following day , Upton says she was fired from the shoot . Someone had called my agency to say I had gotten fat and would not be needed on set [ that day ] , she said . I was devastated , especially because at this point no one from Guess had even seen me . Still , Guess continued offering Upton work , and she agreed , asking her photographer friend to intervene . We came up with a plan that anytime Paul invites himself to my room , I would text Yu Tsai to be there so that I was never alone in a room with him . I was still very nervous and scared because clearly Paul was comfortable with touching me in front of him . But Yu Tsai assured me that he would look out for me , so that s what we did . Upton also suggested that Marciano played mind games , offering her work , but not booking her until the last minute . It made me feel that if I cut off communication with him , I would n t be booked again , she explained . Paul s texting increased , telling me how excited he was to see me , that he wanted me to change in front of him so he could see my naked body getting into his clothes . He asked if I thought of him when I was posing sexy on set . She added , All the language he used was extremely dominant and possessive . At one point , to avoid Paul coming to set , I told him my boyfriend was going to be there . He was absolutely furious at that . It was an emotional and nonstop battle of games , power struggles , and creative avoidance tactics . After Tsai was fired , Marciano retaliated , says Upton . That s when I worked with the photographer Ellen von Unwerth . Paul s behavior became much more aggressive without Yu Tsai there as a buffer . My denials to Paul had to be much more direct . Then I was told the morning of the shoot I was not needed on set and was fired again . Upton s final Guess shoot took place during which she alleges Marciano called her disgusting and spread rumors that she was drinking on set , which Upton denied . She said , I was then told to leave because Paul had said , ‘ Get that fat pig off my set . The model went on to work for Sports Illustrated , and in 2012 , Guess reached out with a $ 400,000 gig the company s highest offer ever , says Upton which she cautiously accepted , and then refused at the last minute . The supermodel says her experience with Marciano affected her self-esteem . I constantly blamed myself after it happened : What am I doing to invite someone to treat me like that or grab me like that ? she said . I wondered if it was how I was presenting myself or what I was wearing . I started slumping my shoulders to hide my breast size , wearing baggy clothes , started despising my own body . She continued : I m sick of being silenced and expected to sweep everything under the rug . I m sick of being expected to laugh off these aggressive advances and accept the power imbalances that exist . I m sick of being expected to endure all of this while being polite and professional through it all . She adds : Paul used his power to make me feel insecure and powerless , but I m not going to let him intimidate me anymore . These men think they are untouchable , but times are changing .

		"paragraph": "Anthony Bourdain was a chef , a writer , a TV host , and a celebrity . He taught people that brunch was a scam , that putting pen to paper is as much a noble act as it is a narcissistic one , that you really only need one outfit when you travel , and that selling out when you do n t have to is one of the fouler things a privileged person chooses to do . But more than that , Bourdain taught people that one of the most reliably good parts of humanity is getting the chance to learn and succumbing to it . Bourdain , who d cut his teeth in the frat house ambiance of the kitchen , did n t really begin traveling the world until he was in his 40s . After decades working as a chef and a struggling novelist , Bourdain found unlikely fame when a piece he wrote for The New Yorker turned into a book deal . The resulting biography Kitchen Confidential was hugely successful , and his publishers wanted more . Bourdain did , too . He teamed up with The Food Network in an attempt to kill two financial birds with one stone that someone would pay for him to travel the world to do research for a new book , and film the process at the same time . I went out there a total novice and neophyte borderline delusional , thinking ‘ this was n t going to hurt at all , he confessed in an episode of No Reservations shot in 2010 . The episode showed footage filmed right after he returned from A Cook s Tour . Bourdain s fatigue at the time was clear : I m traveling around the world and on film every waking minute , and I m not liking it . I want to hide under a blanket for the rest of my life , he says woodenly , without any of the pomposity that had juiced everything he said prior . The Bourdain depicted in A Cook s Tour is almost comically uncomfortable , a caricature of the Bourdain that we re familiar with it was the first time he was responsible for telling stories about real people other than himself , and the effort to get it right when he was so unprepared was obviously taxing . His most immediate first impression of the thing that has become his legacy can seem discordant . After all , the Bourdain who would eventually go on to host No Reservations and Parts Unknown as the ideal globe trekker is energized by new experiences . He was fearless and generous , and seemed to be powered by the same thing that so drained him in A Cook s Tour . But his initial reaction to travel illuminates something about Bourdain s philosophy to life that will later become so instinctive to him that it ll become invisible : Interacting with the world is not a pleasure , but it is a privilege . The most honest way to do it is humbly . When it comes to how most people travel and dine Bourdain s two main methods of interaction passivity is not a popular attitude . Why spend so much money on an unpleasant experience ? When you eat at a restaurant , it s likely that you ve picked the spot from many options and will pick from its menu to best flatter your tastes . The way we travel is similar : We pick experiences by what looks most appetizing , expecting to be delighted , catered to , and satiated by what comes across our table . We are the guests . Foreign lands are our hosts . That is not how Bourdain traveled . He was an interloper , not a guest , which meant that the onus to delight , to cater , and to satiate was entirely on him . That meant trusting people who chose to express their gratitude and love through foods many other food travelers would call bizarre and weird . Not once did he use these words as pejoratives , or more patronizingly , as some annoying shock-jock travelers do as badges of bravery . Bourdain traveled as someone with deep respect and deference to the people he was seeing . He took his shoes off when he went into a Japanese home without complaint . He sat down in a plastic stool with as much gratitude as if it were a Mies van der Rohe . He learned how to say thank you and excuse me in every language his hosts spoke , attempting to get the pronunciations right in ways that were so eager and earnest that it was almost embarrassing if you believed his punk veneer was all there was to him . Bourdain made it easier for us to indulge our own curiosities . It is no coincidence that in toxic conversations about cultural appropriation , eating foreign food is one of the only things where people feel no shame in seeking out and trying . For Bourdain , new foods were always an opportunity to connect with new people and new ideas . Bourdain understood that in seeing what someone eats and how they cook it , he could better understand why they live . Pop anthropologists have long done this before him , with music , with fashion , with sports , with sex but Bourdain was the first to break out of the niche subject he inhabited professionally , because he did it plainly and without pomp , without ever dumbing things down or dramatizing differences . One of the clearest pieces of evidence that his style was spot-on is from the surfeit of praise from people about episodes that featured their hometowns . This is an incredibly curious thing for a show ostensibly promoting places to travel to , not places to grow up in . When Bourdain visited Ecuador , my entire family tuned in , Washington Post reporter Marissa J. Lang tweeted . We did not watch with dread , waiting for the moment he would get it wrong . We watched feeling we would be seen . All morning , people have been describing what it was like to gather with their families to see their backyards through Bourdain s eyes , and know that it d feel both like falling in love for the first time and going home for Thanksgiving . Bourdain was as frank with himself as he was with the subjects he reported on . He has called himself much worse things than his critics have levied on him . He was his own harshest critic . Which is why he must have instinctively felt that the pain that s necessary to travel and tell other people s stories was a sign of his own weakness . But it s clear that he later realized that pain was only part of the journey to empathy and edification . He writes in his book , No Reservations : Around the World on an Empty Stomach : Travel is n't always pretty . It is n't always comfortable . Sometimes it hurts , it even breaks your heart . But that 's okay . The journey changes you it should change you . It leaves marks on your memory , on your consciousness , on your heart , and on your body . You take something with you . Hopefully , you leave something good behind . For someone who has traveled as much as he did , and who left behind so much good , one can imagine how much hurt and heartbreak it took to get there . On his blog , Bourdain s last post was written in 2016 , and in remembrance of poet Jim Harrison . Bourdain knew that his own superpower was that he was a conduit to tell other people s stories it was what made his programs so admirable , and his last post so particularly heart-wrenching . It must have meant something wickedly important to him , to see himself in these lines . Bourdain spent the past two decades reflecting our world back to us . As tribute , here s something he saw himself in : BARKING The moon comes up . The moon goes down . This is to inform you that I did n t die young . Age swept past me but I caught up . Spring has begun here and each day brings new birds up from Mexico . Yesterday I got a call from the outside world but I said no in thunder . I was a dog on a short chain and now there s no chain .

		"paragraph": "New York Mets prospect Tim Tebow appears to be on the fast track . Despite a rough line in Class A , the 29-year-old was moved up a level following Sunday s game . The move was met with some criticism . Tebow was n t exactly tearing it up with the Columbia Fireflies , hitting just .220 / .311 / .336 , with three home runs , over 224 plate appearances . After 64 games , the Mets decided he was ready for the next level . By comparison , Bryce Harper played nine more games in the same league before the Washington Nationals moved him up . Because of that , Tebow s promotion was probably more about the money . The Mets realized they could profit off selling Tebow merchandise with a new team . People want to see him play , and the Mets took advantage of that . It also means that Tebow could move through the organization a lot quicker than expected . If the Mets keep Tebow on the same track , it s possible he could wind up in the majors before the end of the season . If you feel strongly about that , you are more than welcome to place your hard-earned money on it . Bovada has released odds on how high Tebow will move through the organization this season . If you think you know whether Tebow is bound for the Mets , you could make a significant profit . As you can see , the odds do n t just focus on the majors . You can also bet on whether Tebow will appear in Double-A or in Triple-A this year . So , which way are you leaning ? The Mets were pretty quick to promote Tebow despite some shaky stats , and could continue to do that all year . At 29 , he s older than the normal prospect , so the team could be aggressive with him . On top of that , the Mets are 34-41 , and could use Tebow as a September attendance boost if fans start to lose interest . On the other hand , it s not going to get easier as Tebow moves up . If his numbers take a dive as he faces tougher competition , the Mets could pump the brakes on the experiment . If they truly care about his development , the best thing for both sides would be to let Tebow stay at one level until he figures things out . If we were a betting site , we would … you know what , we re not a betting site , so we wo n t tell you how to spend your hard-earned gummy bears .

		"paragraph": "The pro careers of Greg Oden and Jimmer Fredette did n t work out for very different reasons , but both were disappointing given college careers that were successful also for very different reasons . Oden in particularly remains one of the NBA s sadder stories in the long history of draft busts . One of the most talented big men college basketball has ever seen , the seven-footer carried Ohio State to the NCAA Tournament final as a freshman and was hyped as a generational NBA prospect , even more so than a young Kevin Durant . That hype did not work out . Instead , injury after injury swallowed Oden s career and saw him appear in just 105 career games . He eventually retired from the NBA in 2016 . However , Oden s basketball career is n t over . The now-30-year-old made his debut playing for the top-seeded Scarlet & Gray in The Basketball Tournament on Friday , posting 11 points and five rebounds in just 16 minutes of action . With his first basket , Oden showed his post moves were still there . Playing on a team composed of other Ohio State alumni , including Jared Sullinger and Aaron Craft , Oden seemed to be having the time of his life after his successful return to the court . Oden s next challenge will be a game that any college basketball fan should have circled on their calendar . Team Fredette , led by the former unanimous national player of the year , awaits in the Tournament s Super 16 . Fredette s NBA career never took off like some fans imagined the NBA was much better equipped than college teams to handle Fredette , a pure scorer with a shot selection that would make Steph Curry blush . The BYU great averaged just 6.0 points in his NBA career and , five years after being drafted 10th overall by the Kings in the 2011 NBA draft , he had landed with the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association . Fredette found his old scoring success in China , averaging a hair below 37 points per game , but now he s back playing in the U.S. and seeking the Tournament s $ 2 million prize on a team also featuring his old BYU co-star Brandon Davies . The Scarlet & Gray figure to enter Sunday as the favorite as the bracket s No. 1 seed , but who knows what could happen in a game featuring two of college basketball s most disruptive players in recent history .

		"paragraph": "The list of accusations against R. Kelly is so long , it took a 19-minute song to address them . The controversial singer , who has been accused of running a sex cult and holding women against their will at his Chicago and Atlanta homes , tackles the topic and then some in a new , very long song called I Admit , which he previewed on Instagram Live on Sunday . While the 51-year-old cops to the fact that he s no angel ( for example : I admit , I admit that I did / I f *** ed my girlfriend s best friend / Yeah I tapped that in the back of my Benz ) and says he s sorry for my sins , he hits back against the cult claims that were first brought to light one year ago . While at first Kelly is seemingly dismissive about the whole thing singing , What s the definition of a cult ? / What s the definition of a sex slave ? / Go to the dictionary , look it up / Let me know I ll be here waiting he then denies the allegations . The claims were at first made by the parents of women living with the Grammy winner but later included women who alleged they were manipulated , controlled , and abused by Kelly . ( One woman claimed the star knowingly gave her a sexually transmitted disease . ) Say I m abusing these women . What the f *** ? That s some absurd s *** , Kelly sings . They brainwashed , really ? Kidnapped , really ? Ca n t eat , really ? Real talk that s *** sounds silly . His defense also includes lines about how he admits he s a freak who used to go to strip clubs every week and he admits that he likes to f *** with ladies both older and young ( tell me how they call it pedophile because that s *** is crazy ) . He then awkwardly details how the sex he has is always consensual , singing , I admit that I got some girls who love me to pull their hair / And I admit that they love to talk dirty while I pull their hair / Some like me to spank em / Some like to give brain / And what some of these girls want is too much for a radio station . Kelly also compared his relationship style to that of Hugh Hefner , who died last year . He said that when the Playboy founder and publisher left the world , he had a million girls , but we are always going to love Hugh Hefner . Kelly , who describes himself as the most disrespected artist and clearly sees himself as a victim , also addresses Spotify s decision to no longer promote his music at the height of the #MuteRKelly movement this past spring . ( Apple Music and Pandora later followed suit . ) Spotify , took me off they playlist / I admit that I , been underrated / I m not convicted , not arrested , but dragged my name in the dirt , he sings . In the song , Kelly also revealed that he was molested as a young boy and sang about the late Aaliyah , with whom he had a relationship when she was a minor .

		"paragraph": "Are wedding bells ringing for Meg Ryan and John Mellencamp ? There s buzz that the under-the-radar couple is planning to wed in South Carolina this summer . While completely unconfirmed , it would n t be all that surprising , given the pair s penchant for privacy . Unfortunately , the best wedding rumor that Tom Hanks will walk his Sleepless in Seattle and You ve Got Mail co-star down the aisle was just debunked . ( Tears ! ) But that has n t slowed speculation that the couple is secretly engaged . Ryan , 56 , and the 66-year-old rocker have been on-again , off-again since late 2010 . They got together shortly after Mellencamp s split from his ex-wife , Elaine Irwin , to whom he was married for 18 years . Neither Ryan nor Mellencamp spoke much about their romance the first time around , and they ended the relationship as quietly as it began . The couple split in the summer of 2014 due to the long distance between their homes . The actress lives in New York City , while Mellencamp has homes in Indiana and South Carolina , and he said moving would n t be an option . I m too sensitive to live [ in New York ] , he told Rolling Stone in 2013 . I ca n t see poor people . I ca n t see the suffering . I ca n t see the trash on the streets . There was also the whole issue of being followed by paparazzi . I do n t give a f *** about me , but I do n t like it for [ Ryan ] , he exclaimed . I m not leaving Indiana . I m going to die here . Meg is an angel . She was just an angel sent to me at the right time , Mellencamp gushed on Sirius XM s The Howard Stern Show in September 2014 . We tried to have a relationship for three years long distance . Still , the singer hinted at the time that the two could reconcile , saying , We ll see what happens . Mellencamp moved on with Christie Brinkley , dating the model for about a year before splitting in 2016 . As for Ryan , she kept a relatively low profile in the romance department . I m on a little break [ from love ] , she told Closer in 2015 . I m [ in love ] with my life right now in a way that I adore , with my kids and my world . She continued , I love my age . I love my life right now . I love what I know about . I love the person I ve become , the one I ve evolved into . In my life I ve been scrappy as hell , but I feel easy with things now . I think that comes with age . While it initially seemed like Ryan and Mellencamp s split was amicable , the singer hinted at some bad blood . Upon his return to the The Howard Stern Show in 2017 , he exclaimed that women hate me . You know , I love Meg Ryan , he said . She hates me to death . When asked why , Mellencamp responded : I think it s because I m a child . I throw fits , I gripe , I complain . I m moody . Every bad thing that a fella can be , that s me . Stern suggested that his friend call up Ryan and apologize . I ve done that , Mellencamp said . She just does n t want anything to do with me , and I ca n t blame her . Perhaps his public mea culpa was just what was needed to clear the air . Months later , Mellencamp and Ryan were photographed together again . They have a bond , a source told People of the pair . Just like that , they were officially back together . It seems as if their families approve , too . The actress has been seen sporting a ring on that finger at times since their reconciliation . Ryan has two kids Jack , 26 , from her 10-year marriage to Dennis Quaid , and adopted daughter Daisy , 14 . John has five children Michelle , 47 Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Teddi , 36 Justice , 33 Speck , 23 and Hud , 24 from his three marriages . If Mellencamp and Ryan are engaged , it will be his fourth trip down the aisle . He was married to Priscilla Mellencamp ( 1970-1981 ) , Victoria Granucci ( 1981-1989 ) , and Elaine Irwin ( 1992-2011 ) . Read more from Yahoo Entertainment : ",

		"paragraph": "Conor McGregor won his fourth straight UFC fight Saturday night in Las Vegas but it was n't without controversy . The brash Irishman moved ahead in the featherweight rankings with a first round TKO win over Dustin Poirier at UFC 178 , but the unfortunate manner in which it ended still left plenty of questions regarding not just the fight but the rising star 's ability to take on and possibly take out the very best in the world . After a good number of striking combinations thrown from both men , with mostly only glancing connections for either , McGregor caught a ducking Poirier with a left hook to the back of the head . The American appeared to go out and fell to the mat . McGregor followed up with strikes to the downed Poirier , forcing referee Herb Dean to step in and call a stop to the fight . Strictly speaking , strikes to the back of the head area that McGregor hit Poirier on are not allowed in unified MMA rules . However , Dean either did n't notice the placement of the quick shot or , decided no foul could be called because McGregor 's punch seemed to be aimed and thrown at a legal area of Poirier before the Louisiana fighter ducked into it . In either case , McGregor moves on in the 145 pound class with this high-profile , though controversial win , and was quick to call for a title shot in his post-fight interview with Joe Rogan . \" What the other featherweights do n't understand , is that it 's a whole ‘ nother game when they get hit by me , \" McGregor told interviewer Joe Rogan . \" The world title is next . \" Follow Elias on Twitter @EliasCepeda & @YahooCagewriter",

That all went down the drain when Yeezy previewed Pablo at New York City 's Madison Square Garden this past February . After the lyric went viral , Kanye claimed he \" called Taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line , \" and she \" thought it was funny . \" Taylor was quick to deny that . \" Kanye did not call for approval , but to ask Taylor to release his single ' Famous ' on her Twitter account , \" her rep said in a statement to ET at the time . \" She declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message .

I was in on it the whole time . ' And I 'm like , wait , but [ in ] your Grammy speech , you completely dissed my husband just to play the victim again . \" When GQ pressed the 35-year-old reality star on whether or not Taylor and Kanye have been in contact since it all went down , Kim bluntly says , \" No .

		"paragraph": "He did n t know that I could hear them , and I could n t tear my attention away from their private conversation . Do you know what makes you even more special than the baby in mommy s tummy ? my new husband asked my 6-year-old son , who was sitting on his lap . Because I m your best buddy ! he exclaimed , throwing his arms around my husband s neck . Yes , you are ! my husband chuckled back . You are my buddy , and what makes you extra special to me is that your baby brother is being born into our family , but I picked you to be mine . I met you when you were 4 , and I took a good long look at everything that makes you who you are , and I said to myself , ‘ I want to be his daddy , because that s how much I love him . Forever and ever and ever , you re mine , because out of all the little boys in the whole wide world , I picked you . Six months pregnant with my new husband s first biological child , I had tears streaming down my face as I listened to him assure my son his stepson that even though a biological child was on the way , he would never be a step down . Even though he was a little boy whose own biological father my now ex-husband had punched him in the face , and then abandoned him , myself , and my daughter . My children have never seen him again , and for a long time my fiercely protective heart kept men away . Filling the father role was n t something I was seeking to do after so much hurt had been caused by the last one . So instead , I d send my daughter off to the daddy-daughter dance with the husband of a friend , and cheer alone at my son s preschool performances . And when my daughter would cry herself to sleep asking why no daddies wanted to love her , I would remind her that I loved her more than all the daddies in the world . My children were too special , and too precious , for me to settle for anything less than everything . And I was convinced that everything did n t exist . How could anyone love my children as much as I , their own flesh and blood , loved them ? But when I least expected it , he came along . And before I knew it , the officiant was pronouncing us not husband and wife , but a family . My daughter now wears a necklace engraved with The Day I Became Your Dad , and my son can no longer remember a time before my ( new ) husband was here . When my daughter is sick , he sleeps on the floor next to her bed . When she needs ridiculously expensive gluten-free play dough for school , he is the first to whip out his credit card , despite my protests about the price . In fact , when my son was diagnosed with epilepsy that required tens of thousands of dollars in treatment , he never flinched at the bills coming in because , as he told me , we take care of our kids . Right now , he s at karate , cheering on his son , because there are no stepdads in this family , there is only a dad that has stepped up . What we are going through is n t unusual . The word stepdad seems to support the idea that fathers who arrive a bit late are n t quite on par with biological fathers who were there first . But that could n t be further from the truth . There are plenty of examples of this in popular culture too . Matt Damon , stepfather to his wife s oldest daughter , Alexia , does n t refer to her as anything other than his daughter , despite the media being quick to point out the she is the sole stepchild of the couple s four children . It was even Alexia s biological father who pointed out that Matt treats Alexia like she is his own flesh and blood . And recently , country music star Blake Shelton told People magazine that becoming a stepdad to the children he shares with wife Gwen Stefani had shown him a part of himself that he never knew was there . It s definitely an instinct that kind of kicks in , he explained . It s easy to fall in love with those kids . They re pretty special . My husband and I have since given birth to our first shared biological son , who is now 3 months old . And recently I brought up something that had been weighing heavily on my heart since he was born : I asked if having a biological child had made him feel differently about the two children I brought into our marriage . Not one bit , he said without hesitation . Then he paused and added , Well , actually , yeah , it has . It s made me realize that I was always meant to be a dad to all three of them , because I could n t possibly love any of them more for being mine , or less because they did n t start out that way . I love them all like my own , just as I always have , and I always will . They are all mine . I know that I am no special snowflake when it comes to stepdads stepping up , and it s why I cringe every time that I hear someone refer to a stepdad as being not the real dad . What is a real dad , if not a man who steps up to care for children who need him ?

		"paragraph": "Alec Baldwin will reprise his impression of President Donald Trump in the 44th season of Saturday Night Live , the actor revealed during the Origins podcast with author James Andrew Miller , a longtime SNL chronicler . Trump is insane . I think most people know , the guy he is insane . We have a man who is president who is insane Baldwin said during the program . You ca n t go far enough with this idiot . You ca n t go far enough . You ca n t go far enough . The 44th season of Saturday Night Live is slated to kick off on Saturday , September 29 . Lorne Michaels , the executive producer of Saturday Night Live , told Miller that he was glad to have Baldwin return to the role . I think there is probably no other actor who is looking to take that and follow Alec . And I think , for a new cast member to come in and try that would be a really tough thing to do , Michaels said . And yet , Michaels noted , there does not seem to be any guarantee that Baldwin will continue the role from one season to the next . I think with Alec , I ve known him and worked with him for so long , that needless to say I trust him . And the audience connects to him in that role . Sometimes I feel like we are still in campaign mode . But , I thought we see each other a fair amount , so we do n t much talk about it in the offseason . And then , I think he was at the US Open last week , and somebody asked him if he was doing Trump . And he said , ‘ yea . And his agent Matt DelPiano texted me and said , ‘ I think he s doing Trump . And I went oh , ok . But , he is somebody you know you can always count on . Baldwin s portrayal of the 45th President has lent the NBC mainstay a new relevance and made it part of the ongoing political conversation in late night . But other members of the show also view the impression as something ephemeral part of the moment , but never guaranteed to be part of the show forever . No Trump , less Trump I do n t know . Like when it s right , it s right . The funny thing is there is a Trump exhaustion in the country and I feel like from the show even , you know . But it s hard to leave him out of the conversation , said Michael Che , a co-anchor of the show s Weekend Update segment and one of its head writers . I always feel like the one good thing about Saturday Night Live , is it s always been kind of the time capsule of you know , American culture since it s been on the air and it s kind of hard to tell the story of American culture without talking about Donald Trump at least once a week . I mean , we talk about him 40 times a day , just in life , so you know , we re a show where we have a different type of responsibility . We do n t really just do 90 minutes of avant garde comedy but , I do n t know it would be hard . We d miss him I think . Subscribe to Variety Newsletters and Email Alerts !",

		"paragraph": "It 's been more than three years since GM re-entered the midsize pickup truck market with two cars , the GMC Canyon and its twin , the Chevy Colorado . To keep things fresh , GM later added a diesel model of the Canyon for the more heavy-duty users out there . After a week with the most high-end model -- it 's called the Canyon Denali -- with a diesel engine , I 'm sold on the GMC Canyon . It 's comfortable , confident and capable , but it 's hard to make a case for why someone might want the diesel version . Here 's what you need to know about it . When they arrived , the Canyon and Colorado ushered in a new era of refinement and civility in the class . The Toyota Tacoma instantly felt outdated . Even when Toyota updated it shortly thereafter , the Tacoma was still rougher around the edges than the GM entries . Now , a new Honda Ridgeline truck probably wears the comfort crown , but its unibody construction and car-like demeanor make it tough for truck-buyers to take seriously . The Canyon is the happy middle . It 's a real truck with an actual truck frame , but it 's also adorned with leather and high-quality interior trimmings when ordered in its top-of-the-line Denali trim . Priced at $ 48,290 , it 's also adorned with leather and high-quality interior trimmings including cooled seats , CarPlay and a Bose stereo . GM 's infotainment system is also much easier to use than others . More importantly , it feels luxurious on the road . We 'll talk engine noise below , but the well-insulated cabin keeps any other harshness out . It 's also comfortable , with a well-damped ride that does n't exhibit the traditional bounciness of a pickup truck . Handling , too , is n't as ponderous as the trucks of yore . Do n't get any wrong impressions : this is not a sporty vehicle , but its slightly smaller size and confident handling help make parking far less annoying than other trucks Should you need to test that toughness , the Canyon is up to or above the standards of the class . Ignore the lowly 189-horsepower rating on this motor because , with diesel cars , you care about torque . The Canyon delivers a massive 369 pound-feet of torque , good for towing up to 7,600 pounds in four-wheel-drive spec . Finally , the diesel engine is rated for 30 miles per gallon on the highway . That 's class-leading , but you 're also likely to pay more for diesel at the pump . You 're also going to pay more at the dealership , as GMC charges $ 3,730 for the Duramax diesel option . Even if gas prices get high and the math works out in the diesel 's favor , you 're probably not seeing a return there until far down the road . In the meantime , you 're dealing with a decidedly less refined power-train . When GMC dropped off the Canyon , I did n't actually know I was getting a diesel . But in the 15-second drive from the entrance of my garage to the parking space , it was evident that I was n't burning gasoline . This car is louder , vibrates more harshly and feels more lethargic than the gas V6 of the standard vehicle . I would n't get the diesel . I do n't have many other complaints about the Canyon . The fake wood trim adoring the gear lever is tacky and the $ 48,290 is expensive for faux materials . But subtract the diesel premium , and you 're under the $ 45,000 mark . For a top-of-the-line midsize pickup that 's this refined , it 's really quite fair . A Canyon Denali Crew Cab 4x4 with the shorter bed option starts at $ 44,295 . $ 495 gets you this lovely red or a premium silver paint job , which classes up the truck significantly . The Denali comes with everything else you need as standard . The total price comes to $ 44,790 with a premium color paint . If you want a near-luxury body-on-frame pickup but do n't want to step up to the full-size market , GMC is the only game in town . Lucky for us , it happens to be quite good at its job . Besides the sometimes-talkative engine , the Canyon 's cabin is remarkably quiet . There is n't the trademark bounciness that typically soils the ride of a pickup . Plus , despite this being a \" midsize \" truck there 's a massive amount of room in the cabin . For people looking for a premium truck at a good price , the Canyon is unbeatable . But more than that , if you 're considering a premium car and a work pickup , you wo n't be sacrificing much if you get one vehicle that can handle both duties . Rating : Exterior : 5 Interior : 4 Driving Experience : 3.5 Value : 4.5 Overall : 4 Price as configured : $ 48,290",

		"paragraph": "The Latest on the 10th Sunday of the NFL season ( all times Eastern ) : 11:35 p.m. Tom Brady threw three touchdown passes and the New England Patriots matched their own AFC record with their 12th consecutive road win , pummeling the Denver Broncos 41-16 Sunday night . Brady improved to 8-9 against the Broncos , the only team he has a losing record against , and won for just the fourth time in 11 trips to Denver . His 86th regular season road win broke a tie with Peyton Manning for most all-time . These teams have represented the AFC in the last four Super Bowls , and the Broncos were hoping a visit from their rivals would help shake them from their funk , one that included a 28-point loss at Philadelphia a week earlier . Instead , the Broncos saw their losing streak reach five games , their longest skid in seven seasons , and they lost back-to-back games to the Patriots in Denver for the first time since 1966 . 10:55 p.m. Umpire Jeff Rice was taken off the field on a cart after he appeared to hit his head on the turf following a punt . Denver 's Jamal Carter was blocking New England 's Trevor Reilly when Reilly rolled into the back of Rice , whose legs were taken out from under him . Rice stayed down for several moments before walking to the cart late in the third quarter . Reilly came over to say something to Rice before Rice left the field . Pat Graham reporting from Denver . 10:25 p.m. Tom Brady was n't perfect in the first half . It only appeared that way . He did throw four incomplete passes . The New England quarterback was 12 of 16 for 136 yards and two TDs in the opening half against the Denver Broncos . His QB rating was 139.6 . Not only that , but Brady seamlessly worked newly acquired tight end Martellus Bennett back into the offense . Bennett caught two passes for 32 yards despite a shoulder injury that led to his release from Green Bay . The Patriots claimed Bennett on Thursday after he was waived . He played for New England last season . Pat Graham reporting from Denver . 9:35 p.m. It 's been a terrible special teams night for the Denver Broncos and it is n't even halftime yet . For openers , Isaiah McKenzie muffed a punt that set up Rex Burkhead 's 14-yard TD catch early in the first . Minutes later , Dion Lewis returned a kickoff 103 yards for a score . If all that was n't enough , Riley Dixon had his punt blocked by Burkhead . It led to 28-yard field goal from Stephen Gostkowski . 8:30 p.m. With just two games left in the NFL 's 10th week , the standings do n't look all that different than they looked before the week began . The Rams , Eagles , Saints and Vikings are in first place in the NFC , which no longer has a winless team , as the 49ers win over the Giants put San Francisco at 1-9 . In the AFC , the division leaders include the Chiefs , Steelers and Patriots ( who are playing in the late game against the Broncos ) . In the AFC South , the Jaguars and Titans are tied at 6-3 . Tennessee has a short week before traveling to play Pittsburgh Thursday . The Browns remain winless , and they face Jacksonville next week . 6:10 p.m. Running back Devonta Freeman has a concussion and has been ruled out of the Falcons ' game against the Cowboys . Freeman was hurt on Atlanta 's opening drive , when he was given the ball on the team 's first two plays . After gaining one yard on his first carry , he was hit by Cowboys linebacker Anthony Hitchens on second down . Freeman appeared shaken by the hit and walked off the field , escorted by trainers . After being taken to the team 's observation tent on the sideline , Freeman went to the locker room . Freeman missed the Falcons ' last two preseason games while in the concussion protocol . The injury leaves Tevin Coleman as Atlanta 's primary running back . Meanwhile , Cowboys linebacker Sean Lee is out with a hamstring injury also suffered in the first quarter . Charles Odum reporting from Atlanta 5:35 p.m. The Houston Texans defense is off to an impressive start against the high-powered Rams offense . Jadeveon Clowney and his teammates limited Jared Goff and the Rams to 131 total yards in the first half at the Coliseum , keeping Los Angeles out of the end zone entirely . The Rams entered the game with the NFL 's highest-scoring offense at 32.9 points per game . Greg Zuerlein hit three field goals for the Rams , who led 9-7 at halftime . Zuerlein has already surpassed his previous career-high for a season with 27 field goals in the first nine games for the Rams , who are mediocre in the red zone despite their prolific points totals . Greg Beacham reporting from Los Angeles 4:51 p.m. Three players took a knee during the national anthem before the New York Giants game at the San Francisco 49ers , as the rest of the league stood during Veterans Day weekend . 49ers Eric Reid and Marquise Goodwin , both of whom have been protesting for most of the season , knelt , as did Giants defensive end Olivier Vernon , who was just activated . Vernon had been protesting while he was injured . The NFL Players Association had asked all players to observe a two-minute moment of silence before games to honor veterans . Other players who have been protesting most of the season stood for the anthem this week , including the Seahawks Michael Bennett , who stood before Thursday night 's game . Titans receiver Rishard Matthews walked onto the field holding hands with soldiers and stood with teammates for the anthem for the first time since President Donald Trump criticized players for protesting . Former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began the protest movement last season . He remains unsigned and has filed a complaint that team owners colluded against him because of the protests aimed at police brutality against African-Americans and other issues . 3:52 p.m. Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Deshone Kizer is back on the field , trying to rally his team from a 14-point deficit late in the fourth quarter . He left the game with a rib injury after taking a hit from Quandre Diggs . After being evaluated in the locker room and watching Cody Kessler take some snaps , Kizer went back into the game with 4:28 left in the fourth quarter . Larry Lage reporting from Detroit . 2:52 p.m. Green Bay lost another running back when Ty Montgomery got hurt in the first half of the Packers ' game at Chicago . The team announced in the third quarter that Montgomery had a rib injury . Aaron Jones departed in the first quarter with a knee injury . Montgomery had a 37-yard touchdown run in the second , helping Green Bay to a 10-6 lead at the break . He finished with six carries for 54 yards . The injuries for Montgomery and Jones left the Packers with only one true halfback , Jamaal Williams . Montgomery started his career as a receiver and was converted to running back last season because of injuries . Jay Cohen reporting from Chicago 2:37 p.m. The New Orleans Saints say running back Daniel Lasco has feelings in his extremities after sustaining a spinal injury making a tackle on a kickoff return . Lasco was loaded into an ambulance on the field and taken to the hospital . He was hurt six minutes into the second quarter when he appeared to lower his head while tackling Bills returner Brandon Tate . Lasco moved his left leg while lying face-down on the field before being rolled on his back by Saints medical staff . John Wawrow , reporting from Orchard Park , New York . 2:05 p.m. Cincinnati linebacker Vontaze Burfict has been ejected for contact with an official . Burfict initially was flagged for a late hit on DeMarco Murray and apparently made contact with an official pleading his case . The flag for his ejection came two plays after the Murray hit . The linebacker did n't immediately leave the sideline . Murray dove over the top for a touchdown , putting Tennessee up 14-6 , before Burfict started walking toward the locker room . Burfict talked to some fans behind the team bench and raised both arms in the air before finally going to the locker room . The Bengals linebacker has been among NFL 's most suspended and most frequently fined players . He started this season with a three-game suspension for a hit during the preseason . He also had a history of personal fouls at Arizona State that factored into every NFL team passing on him in the 2012 draft . This is the second straight week the Bengals have had a player ejected . Wide receiver A.J. Green was ejected after grabbing Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey around the neck and throwing a punch . Green was fined $ 42,541 for his fight . Teresa M. Walker reporting from Nashville , Tennessee 2 p.m. Titans kicker Ryan Succop finally has missed , ending his NFL record of successful field goals inside 50 yards at 56 . Succop missed wide right on a 48-yard attempt with 8:05 left in the second quarter Sunday against Cincinnati . Succop came into the game having easily topped the previous NFL mark of 46 consecutive field goals inside the 50 that had previously been set by Matt Bryant of Atlanta between 2013 and 2015 . The Titans kicker came into this game 21 of 23 on field goals , and his 79 points ranked him third in the NFL . Teresa M. Walker reporting from Nashville , Tennessee 1:58 p.m. Corey Grant 's longest two runs of the season came on fake punts . Grant juked one defender , made another miss and then zigzagged his way for a 56-yard touchdown on a fourth-and-7 play against the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday . He had 58-yarder that was stopped set up a touchdown against Baltimore in London in September . It 's also the second straight week Jacksonville got a huge play from special teams . Jaydon Mickens returned a punt 63 yards for a touchdown in a 23-7 victory against Cincinnati last week . The Jaguars signed special teams coordinator Joe DeCamillis in the offseason in hopes of improving one of the league 's worst units . Mark Long reporting from Jacksonville , Florida 1:52 p.m. Green Bay running back Aaron Jones has left the Packers ' game at Chicago with a knee injury . Jones departed in the first quarter , but it was unclear when exactly he got hurt . The team announced in the second quarter that he was done for the day . Jones finishes with three carries for 12 yards . Jay Cohen reporting from Chicago 1:15 p.m. No NFL players protested during the national anthem before early games as the league celebrated Veterans Day weekend by honoring the military . The NFL Players Association had asked all players to observe a two-minute moment of silence before games to honor veterans . Even players who have been protesting most of the season stood for the anthem this week , including the Seahawks Michael Bennett , who stood before Thursday night 's game . Titans receiver Rishard Matthews walked onto the field holding hands with soldiers and stood with teammates for the anthem for the first time since President Donald Trump criticized players for protesting . Former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began the protest movement last season . He remains unsigned and has filed a complaint that team owners colluded against him because of the protests aimed at police brutality against African-Americans and other issues . 12:30 p.m. Who would 've thought the Week 10 schedule would feature just one matchup between two teams with winning records . And surprise , surprise , it 's the Buffalo Bills ( 5-3 ) hosting the New Orleans Saints ( 6-2 ) . Despite an offseason overhaul , Buffalo has matched its best start during its 17-season playoff drought the longest active streak in North America 's four major professional sports . The Bills have n't been 6-3 or better since 1999 , and are 4-0 at home . The Saints have won six straight and are a victory short of matching their longest winning streak since 2011 . New Orleans has a chance to open 7-2 or better for only the seventh time in franchise history , and first since 2013 .

		"paragraph": "CHICAGO ( AP ) From the moment they identified him as the quarterback to lift their struggling franchise , the Chicago Bears envisioned big games from Mitchell Trubisky . As breakthroughs go , this was a huge one . Trubisky threw a career-high six touchdown passes one shy of the NFL record and the NFC North-leading Bears pounded the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 48-10 on Sunday . The Bears ( 3-1 ) won their third straight with Trubisky delivering the sort of performance general manager Ryan Pace envisioned when he traded up a spot to draft the prized quarterback with the No. 2 overall pick last year . He finished one TD pass short of the franchise mark set by Sid Luckman against the New York Giants in 1943 . Luckman is tied with seven others in NFL history to throw seven TD passes in a game . The Bears also racked up 483 yards in this one , nearly matching their record of 488 in that same game , on the way to their highest point total since 51-20 victory over Tennessee in 2012 . \" It 's very humbling because you know the history of the Bears and how many great players have come through this organization , \" Trubisky said . \" For me , you 're just trying to create your own legacy and try to make a path . \" The defense did its part , harassing Ryan Fitzpatrick before Jameis Winston took over to start the second half . And the Bears ( 3-1 ) matched their longest win streak since a 3-0 start in 2013 . Trubisky had never thrown for more than two touchdowns in a game . But he tossed five in the first half alone as Chicago grabbed a 38-3 lead . The only other player with more in a single half since 1991 was Green Bay 's Aaron Rodgers with six in the first two quarters against the Bears in a romp at Lambeau Field in November 2014 . Trubisky had no trouble finding wide-open receivers against a struggling secondary , completing 19 of 26 passes for 354 yards . \" Hopefully , this is a day where we look back down the road here , \" Bears coach Matt Nagy said , \" and say , ' Remember that day where he had that great game ? ' And it helped catapult him into being a great quarterback . \" Khalil Mack had a strip-sack in the first half against Fitzpatrick . That made him the first player with a sack and forced fumble in four straight games since Robert Mathis for Indianapolis in 2005 . He also appeared to tip the ball as Winston released a pass that Danny Trevathan picked off on the first drive of the second half . OVERMATCHED Coming off a tight loss to Pittsburgh on Monday night , the Buccaneers ( 2-2 ) were simply overwhelmed in this one . \" We should fire every person that was on that field today , starting with me . That was horrific , \" coach Dirk Koetter said . Koetter said Winston \" probably \" did enough to regain the starting job , but would n't quite commit to that . Tampa Bay decided to stick with Fitzpatrick as the starting quarterback even though Winston was back from a three-game suspension for violating the NFL 's personal conduct policy . But after becoming the first player in NFL history to top 400 yards passing in three consecutive games , Fitzpatrick was 9 of 18 for 126 yards and got sacked twice . Winston was 16 for 20 with 145 yards , one touchdown and two interceptions . CATCHING ON Chicago 's Tarik Cohen had a career-high 121 yards receiving and a touchdown . Taylor Gabriel had a personal-best 104 yards receiving to go with two TD catches . Trey Burton caught a 39-yard touchdown on the game 's opening drive and finished with 86 yards . Allen Robinson caught a 14-yarder late in the first quarter his first TD since signing with Chicago in the offseason . HICKS EJECTED Bears defensive tackle Akiem Hicks was ejected for pushing an official late in the first half . The incident occurred after Eddie Jackson intercepted a pass by Fitzpatrick . Hicks was involved in a scuffle away from the play with a Buccaneers player . Down judge Mike Carr had separated them when Hicks charged back and pushed the official , referee Jerome Boger told a pool reporter . \" It was just a deliberate act , when he knew the official was there in-between , \" Boger said . Hicks remained on the sideline for a few plays before leaving the field and threw his shoulder pads and jersey into the stands . NATIONAL ANTHEM There were no obvious protests by either team . INJURIES Buccaneers : TE O.J. Howard left in the first half because of a knee injury . ... CB Carlton Davis III aggravated a groin injury . Bears : LB Sam Acho left in the first half with a pectoral injury . UP NEXT Buccaneers : Have bye week . At Atlanta on Oct. 14 . Bears : Have bye week . At Miami on Oct. 14 .

		"paragraph": "Gaza City ( Palestinian Territories ) ( AFP ) - Israel troops on Friday shot dead two Palestinians taking part in protests along the Gaza border , the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave said . The ministry named the dead men as Karim Abu Fatayer , 30 , shot near the central Gaza Strip town of Bureij and Sadi Moamer , 26 , killed near Rafah , in the south . It said that both men were shot in the head . At least 270 other Palestinians were wounded , 70 of them by gunfire , the ministry said . The Israeli military did not know of any deaths but said that troops had opened fire in border incidents . At least 171 Gazans have been killed by Israeli fire since late March , mostly during border clashes and protests . One Israeli soldier was shot dead by a Palestinian sniper in July . Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza , including its Hamas rulers , have fought three wars since 2008 and tensions since late March have led to fears of yet another full-blown conflict . There have been three intense flare-ups since July , the latest on Thursday , when Israel responded to some 180 rockets and mortars fired from Gaza with widespread air strikes . An Israeli official said on condition of anonymity Wednesday that truce talks mediated by Egyptian and United Nations officials had reached an initial set of \" understandings \" leading to calm on the border over the past few days . Senior Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya told AFP on Friday that a durable truce with Israel was near . \" In my opinion , yes , we are nearing an agreement , \" he said . He added that the UN and Egyptian talks taking place in Egypt with various Palestinian factions have \" taken a big step forward towards understandings with the occupation ... and the possibility of restoring calm \" .",

		"paragraph": "Despite warnings from gynecologists , women regularly turn to douches , vaginal wipes , and moisturizers to try to clean themselves below the belt . But a new study finds that women who use these products are three times more likely to contract a vaginal infection than those who do n t . For the study , which was published in the journal BMC Women s Health , researchers from the University of Guelph in Ontario surveyed nearly 1,500 Canadian women about their overall vaginal health , any products they used , and how often they had vaginal issues . A whopping 95 percent of the women surveyed reported using some type of vaginal product , with the most common being anti-itch creams , moisturizers and lubricants , and feminine wipes . The researchers found that women who use gel sanitizers are eight times more likely to have a yeast infection than those who do n t , and almost 20 times more likely to get a bacterial infection . Similarly , women who used feminine washes or gels are nearly 3.5 times more likely to have a bacterial infection and 2.5 times more likely to report a urinary tract infection . Those who use feminine wipes are twice as likely to have a UTI , and those who use lubricants or moisturizers are 2.5 times more likely to have a yeast infection . The researchers point out that it s hard to know whether the products themselves are causing the infections or whether the women are using the products to try to address their vaginal issues . But , they note , there is definitely a link . The news is n t shocking to experts . Many of these products contain fragrances or antiseptics that can disrupt the vaginal flora , the natural balance of bacteria that exists in the vagina , women s health expert Jennifer Wider , MD , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . When the balance is messed up , the result can make it easier for the ‘ bad bacteria to grow and cause an infection , she says . Feminine douches or washes are particularly concerning , Wider says , pointing out that the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists , and many health experts warn against it . Of course , it could be that some women are resorting to using these products when they already have an issue . There are women who will self-treat if they have a vaginal discharge or odor , Jessica Shepherd , MD , a minimally invasive gynecologist at Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . But then they re not getting to the source of the issue and are just masking it or even exacerbating it . The vagina and vulvar region are self-cleaning , making all of these products unnecessary , Christine Greves , MD , a board-certified ob-gyn at the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies in Orlando , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . Your vaginal microbiome is helpful at preventing infections like bacterial vaginosis and yeast infections , she says . But it s very sensitive , and feminine products can inevitably affect that area , especially if you put them inside your vagina . It s important for women to understand that it s normal for the vagina to have a slight odor , Shepherd says . It s usually a slight musky smell , but it should n t be overwhelming , she says . If it varies from that , you need to let your doctor know . If you re concerned about your normal vaginal odor , Wider recommends showering regularly and using a small amount of mild , unscented soap with water on your external genitalia only . Certain infections , like bacterial vaginosis , can cause a strong vaginal odor that need a doctor s care , Greves points out , and masking it with a product is n t going to fix the underlying problem . So , if you notice that your vaginal scent is off or you have another vaginal issue that you ve been attempting to self-treat , see your ob-gyn . They should be able to help .

The Duchess of Cambridge 's little sister was spotted this week leaving the KX health club in London after reportedly taking a dance-based workout class . She bundled up her bump in a royal blue coat , and paired the outerwear with a patterned dress , statement shades , pristine white sneakers , and a structured blush tote . Fitness has been important to Pippa throughout her pregnancy , and she 's been documenting her journey with an exercise column in Waitrose magazine . \" As the pregnancy months roll on , keeping active even for a sport fanatic like me is getting increasingly challenging , \" she wrote about the \" final weeks \" of her pregnancy . \" But I m determined to keep agile in preparation for labour , delivery and post-natal recovery . \" She also highlighted the \" barre-inspired workouts \" that she 's particularly loving right now . \" [ They 're ] excellent for pregnant women in all trimesters as you mostly rely on your body weight , so it means little impact for your joints and is generally low risk , \" she said , before demonstrating a few of the moves in the publication . Pippa has n't shared her due date publicly yet , but it is rumored to be sometime soon . Perhaps that 's why she was the only Middleton not in attendance at Kate 's close friend Sophie Carter 's wedding over the weekend . Grandma Carole and Grandpa Michael were both on-hand to cheer on Prince George and Princess Charlotte in their roles as page boy and bridesmaid . Uncle James was at the celebration as well .

		"paragraph": "One of the biggest plays in a game full of big plays in last night s Red Sox-Astros game was the call of fan interference that took a home run away from Jose Altuve . Well , actually , it did n t technically take a home run away , because right field umpire Joe West never called it a home run to begin with . He called it , sorta , tentatively , fan interference and it was thrown in the lap of replay officials . For my part and , it seems to me , for the part of most folks watching the game West blew the call . The fan in question did not reach out onto the field of play Mookie Betts ‘ glove entered the stands and the rules clearly state that no interference is called if a spectator comes in contact with a batted or thrown ball without reaching onto the field of play . It s only if he or she reaches out onto the field . If the ball is in the stands , all s fair in love and souvenir-snagging . After the game , West was interviewed about the call . Here is how he explained it . Q . What did you see that prompted the initial call of fan interference ? JOE WEST : Well , when he jumped up to reach for the ball , the spectator reached out of the stands and hit him over the playing field and closed his glove . Q . So the ball had not yet crossed the railing ? JOE WEST : No . Q. And Betts glove had not yet crossed the railing , do you believe ? JOE WEST : No . Q. Okay . Did the fan JOE WEST : Here s the whole play , here s the whole play . He hit the ball to right field . He jumped up to try to make a catch . The fan interfered with him over the playing field . That s why I called spectator interference . Q . So it s a clear call in your mind ? JOE WEST : Yes . Q. Were there already was there a single call that you saw , that the replay officials saw on replay that confirmed JOE WEST : I do n t know what he saw . He just the replay official said I was right . Q. Okay . JOE WEST : That s all . He said I have nothing that can change it . That last bit is not entirely true , by the way . They did n t say , specifically , that West was right . Rather , they could not find sufficient evidence to overturn West , so the call stood . Which is an important distinction : if the ruling was that West was definitively correct , the ruling would ve been that West s call was confirmed . That is not what they said . They said the call stands , which meant that they did n t have enough evidence to overturn West . That s a different issue in its entirety , by the way : the deference given to the field umpires and the high burden replay officials have to overturn them . Here , I suspect it was a matter of them not having sufficient camera angles establishing that the fan had not reached onto the field . I think that s nuts given what even the primary view and some basic common sense showed Betts did not run to the wall and then jump straight up , failing to break the plane into the stands but the current replay system places a high burden on replay guys overruling the field umpires . That whole setup is dumb . This is not the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and guys like Joe West should not be treated like District Court judges to whom deference should always be granted . Replay officials have better views almost every single time and they should be able to simply substitute their judgment rather than meet some high burden aimed , I suspect , at making field umpires feel like they re not losing power now that baseball takes a 21st century approach to officiating rather than a 19th century approach . Unfortunately for the Astros , that is not how the replay rule works . Unfortunately for the Astros , Joe West s judgment was to be deferred to . Unfortunately for the Astros , West blew that call and , unfortunately for the Astros , it cost them a two-run homer that could ve changed the outcome of this game . Follow @craigcalcaterra",

The 49ers quarterback also was responsible for four of his team 's five turnovers in a 28-18 loss to the previously winless Arizona Cardinals on Sunday at Levi 's Stadium . \" Obviously , after a loss like that , it does n't feel good for anybody , \" Beathard said . \" We 're going to stay positive throughout it all because we 've got to move on to the next week . Obviously , we 'll watch the tape of this one , learn from it and get better from it . \" But you ca n't dwell on it for the next few days . Obviously , today and tonight will hurt and sting , but you 've got to get past it . \" The 49ers ( 1-4 ) were left kicking themselves after thoroughly dominating the statistical columns . The Cardinals scored 21 points off 49ers turnovers , including the game-clinching play on which linebacker Josh Bynes scored on a 23-yard fumble return off Hassan Reddick 's sack and strip of Beathard in the fourth quarter . 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan did n't place all the blame on Beathard , but he did n't absolve him , either . \" He 's a quarterback , and there 's a lot of responsibility on the quarterback to protect the ball , \" Shanahan said . \" There 's 10 other guys out there that can make it easier on him , too . I 'll get through all of them . Usually , fumbles it 's hard to pin on the quarterback .

Said left tackle Joe Staley : \" He 's back there trying to do what he 's got to do . We 've got to give him more time . \" The 49ers must regroup in time to be ready for the national stage , as they travel next week to face the Green Bay Packers on Monday night .

		"paragraph": "FLOWERY BRANCH , Ga. ( AP ) The Atlanta Falcons will be missing another key starter for Sunday 's game against Carolina . Two-time Pro Bowl running back Devonta Freeman was ruled out after missing the entire week of practice with a knee injury , another blow to a team that was already reeling from injuries to defensive stalwarts Keanu Neal and Deion Jones . Coach Dan Quinn said he 's hopeful that Freeman 's injury is n't too serious . But there was a bit of uncertainty in the coach 's voice when he spoke after practice on a sweltering Friday afternoon . \" We 're under the hope that it 's not a long-term thing , \" Quinn said . \" When he can do the violent , explosive cuts that make him him , we 'll certainly get him in there . \" Freeman was injured in a season-opening loss to Philadelphia . Even though the Falcons had a 10-day break before their second game , the running back was not able to overcome the latest in what has become an alarming series of injuries . During the 2017 season , Freeman sustained two concussions and a right knee injury . He missed two games and was n't nearly as effective as the two previous years even when he was able to get on the field . Freeman finished with 865 yards rushing and seven touchdowns , along with 36 receptions . The starting spot is still in good hands with Tevin Coleman , but Freeman 's injury deprives the Falcons of their 1-2 punch out of the backfield . Rookie Ito Smith , a fourth-round draft pick , moves up on the depth chart . Recently signed Brian Hill could also get some playing time . The Falcons did n't even play Freeman during the preseason , wanting to ensure he was healthy when the games counted . Then he went down in the very first one . While Freeman is again dealing with an ailing right knee , Quinn said it 's not the same injury as last season . \" There 's nothing structurally wrong , \" the coach said . \" He got hit on it and it 's sore . When it bruises up and gets sore , you ca n't explode on it . He 's such a unique player , but when you ca n't do your stuff , you ca n't do it . \" In Week 1 , the Falcons lost Neal to a season-ending knee injury , while Jones was placed on injured reserve with a foot problem . The Falcons are hopeful that Jones will be able to return this season , but he will have to miss a minimum of eight games . Quinn said two backups also will miss Sunday 's game : offensive guard Ben Garland ( knee ) and receiver Russell Gage ( knee ) .

Entering Monday , of the six nations most commonly tipped for success in Russia , four had failed to win . A fifth had needed VAR , an own goal and goal-line technology to scrape by an underdog . And the sixth ? The sixth was Belgium , which kicked off its campaign against Panama in Sochi on Monday . And despite what scoreboards will tell you , it fell in line with the trend . The Red Devils beat Panama 3-0 behind Dries Mertens , Kevin De Bruyne , Eden Hazard and Romelu Lukaku . But they sputtered in a game through which many expected them to stroll . And they needed an early contender for goal of the tournament to bail them out . Mertens broke a 0-0 tie with a majestic 47th-minute volley : And from there , the game opened up for the Belgians . But they had to work for their three points . Belgium has as much top-tier attacking talent as any team in Russia . But against a Panamanian side content to sit deep , and determined to rupture the game s rhythm with foul after foul , the favorites had trouble in the first half . Both Hazard and Mertens , playing as wide forwards behind Lukaku , struggled to find space behind a crowded five-man Panamanian midfield . Panama s fouls functioned just as planned . And Belgium was sloppy . It under-hit passes out to wingbacks . It mis-hit through-balls and took a few shoddy first touches in important moments . At halftime , a draw was n t difficult to envision . But Mertens broke the deadlock in style , and the game changed . Panama was always going to get one chance . One chance to score a famous goal and nab a famous result . That chance came after 54 minutes . Belgium is borderline incapable of a complete defensive clampdown because it has players like Yannick Carrasco , a true attacking winger , shouldering responsibility . The left wingback switched off with Panama maintaining some rare attacking-half possession . Panamanian right back Michael Murillo sprinted past him , and in behind the Belgian defense . Murillo s shot was turned away by Thibaut Courtois , though , and it was the last clear look at goal Los Canaleros would get while a draw was within reach . They had to chase the game , but just were n t capable . And once they came out of their defensive shell , they were hopeless . One moment of brilliance from De Bruyne put the game to bed . He poked a swerving cross into a dangerous area . Lukaku , who was barely onside , powered his header in for 2-0 :",

		"paragraph": "Celebrities use social media as a tool to get closer to fans , but one man crossed the line in a big way with Megan Mullally . The Will & Grace star said she was doing an Instagram Live on Wednesday when a man exposed himself and played with his genitals during her broadcast . She later learned that the user , whose account was based outside the United States , boasted of a video in his highlights section asking if people would like to see a live gang rape , she wrote . So the actress rallied her users and went on a mission to shut down the account of the man , whom she referred to as a sexual predator , on the social media platform . Believe it or not , it took Instagram a little time to address the matter . After her initial post , she made a video telling the Mark Zuckerberg-owned company that it needed to take action against the sexual predator . In it , she pointed out that a lot of kids and teenagers follow me and watch my live videos . why is it fine with you that a man would expose himself and play with his penis ?? When that did n t do the trick , she called in her husband , actor Nick Offerman , for reinforcement , just in case you do n t want to listen to the womenfolk . In that post , in which she again asked for Instagram to address the situation , the #TimesUp supporter wrote , I have a lot of #metoo moments . now i have one more . and you re doing nothing about it . A few hours later , the two-time Emmy winner was back with better news . Instagram had suspended the user s account .
