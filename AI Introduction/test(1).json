		"paragraph": "The actress , who has been on The Social several times previously , explained her decision to reach out to the show as a platform to share her story . I realized that I had a responsibility that I needed to come forward and say it , she said . I did n t want to go chasing after some publication , I did n t want to post it on social media , it seemed like my voice was too quiet if I did that . Holly described her initial reaction to the New York Times expose on Weinstein , stating that she was floored when she initially read it because it felt like her story as well . The actress continued : This happened in the late 1990s I was in my 30s . I was not a young ingenue , and I was certainly not new to Hollywood I was a seasoned , Hollywood person . She explained that she was already familiar with Weinstein , having worked with him on Beautiful Girls and interacted with him socially . A meeting was set up between her and Weinstein at a hotel to talk about her future with his company , which she did n t find abormal at all because she had routinely met with producers , writers , and directors in hotel suites . She described the early stages of their meeting as normal : Everything was absolutely professional from the get-go . After some small talk , Holly said that Weinstein asked to be excused , and returned to the main part of the suite wearing a hotel bathrobe . No doubt it was odd , she said , however , when he walked in and he was in the bathrobe , he said , ‘ Okay , let s get to it , this is what we ve got going on at my company , these are the scripts we have in the pipeline , this is what I think might be right for you , and he gestured for me to follow him . Holly recounted that she followed him into the bedroom part of the suite as he continued talking . After entering the suite , she said that Weinstein dropped his robe , went into the bathroom , and began using the toilet . At this point my head was exploding , she said . He keeps the conversation going , he finishes , he turns on the shower , he gets in the shower . He s continually talking to me , he s in the shower washing himself . Leaning out , asking me for responses . My head is going crazy at this point . He s acting like the situation is normal . He s acting like we re having a normal encounter . I m thinking to myself , ‘ Am I just a prude ? Am I supposed to be more open minded ? I did n t quite know how to handle myself at that moment . According to Holly , Weinstein left the shower , dried off , and began approaching her while still naked . The adrenaline rush I felt , I wanted to flee , I was scared . He told me that I looked stressed and he thought maybe I could use a massage , maybe I could give him a massage . I began just sort of babbling like I was a child , I think it was just the fear . She told him she did n t have a massage license and that maybe they could call the front desk to have a masseuse come up . Holly said Weinstein began to threaten her , stating that she needed to keep him as [ her ] ally and that it would be a bad decision if she left the room . At that point , Holly said , she pushed him and ran . After leaving the hotel , Holly went to a previously planned dinner with other Hollywood notables , who , when she explained why she arrived distraught , said that since Weinstein had n t raped or assaulted her , she should keep [ her ] mouth shut because it s Harvey Weinstein . The actress continued that although she is n t certain the encounter had any negative impacts on her career , she did pivot away from film in the intervening years . Holly also recounted a later experience with Weinstein , in which the two were staying at the same hotel and he requested to meet her . She , however , went to great lengths to avoid him . More than 30 women have come forward since the New York Times published an investigative report on the Hollywood producer , alleging sexual harassment and assault . Fired from The Weinstein Company , Weinstein was also expelled from the Producers Guild and the Motion Picture Academy . His wife Georgina Chapman has also filed for divorce .

During the powerful performance , the participants wore new message tees . The immigrant families shirts read We are all human beings , while Logic s shirt was emblazoned with a more blunt slogan , F * CK THE WALL . At the number s climactic and most tear-jerking moment , a wall separating the families onstage came falling down , symbolically reuniting the children with their parents . Logic and Tedder s One Day music video , released last Friday , tells the story of an immigrant teenager forcibly separated at the border from his family . Jefferson Arpi , a 15-year-old youth leader with United We Dream , said in a press statement on VMAs night : Logic s music video showed that even though our families face a lot of pain , we are strong , we are fighters , and we are human .

		"paragraph": "BEREA , Ohio ( AP ) While Josh Gordon 's away , the Browns may launch Plan B with their wide receivers . Dez Bryant is on their radar . As they await clarity on Gordon 's cloudy situation , Cleveland general manager John Dorsey said Wednesday the team has discussed signing Bryant , the former Dallas star released by the Cowboys in April . Gordon is missing the start of training camp as part of his treatment to battle drug and alcohol addictions , and the team does not known when or if the 27-year-old will be back . Dorsey said he \" absolutely \" expects Gordon to return in 2018 . \" I 'm going to respect Josh 's privacy and I will continue to say that and let him do what he has to do moving forward , \" Dorsey said . \" Then , when he comes back , we 'll embrace him , that 's how we 're going to do it . \" In the meantime , the Browns have interest in Bryant , a three-time Pro Bowler and one of the game 's top playmakers since 2010 . \" He 's a very talented player , \" Dorsey said . \" Have we had discussions about Dez Bryant ? Yeah , that 's natural . You 're going to have discussions like that . Now , we 'll see what comes to fruition in the next couple days , but we 've talked about it . You have to talk about these things . \" Especially given Gordon 's track record . Despite his numerous missteps , the Browns are standing by the talented receiver . They believe Gordon has turned his life around and are counting on the former Pro Bowler , who has played just 10 games since 2013 due to numerous NFL drug violations , to help this season . Dorsey does n't know when Gordon will return , and the club changed his roster designation from the non-football illness list to \" did not report \" so it would have roster flexibility . \" Josh is 100 percent committed to the Cleveland Browns , \" Dorsey said . \" The Cleveland Browns are 100 percent committed to him . He 's had a great offseason . He 's had great training . So you know what , let 's just see what happens here . Let 's see what happens . All I care about is let 's respect his privacy . Let 's see him move forward . \" An NFL spokesman said earlier this week that Gordon has not been suspended again , and that there is no timetable on his return . However , both Dorsey and coach Hue Jackson refused to answer whether they 've received assurances from the league that Gordon is not facing further discipline . On the eve of his third training camp , Jackson , who has not spoken with Gordon , wanted the focus on his available players . \" Obviously we 'd like to have all of our players here . But at the same time we know things do come up , \" he said . \" And I think as a staff we prepared for anything and everything . I think in my going on three years here I 've seen it all . So I 'm not surprised by anything that can happen . I think if we make it more than what it is . \" You 're talking about a young man that 's doing everything he can to put himself in the best position to be better in his life . And I think that 's great for Josh . At the same time we have a football team to get ready , and that 's what we 're going to do . All we can really worry about are the guys that are here and coach the guys that are here and get them better and when Josh is ready to return he 'll return . \" With Gordon 's status unclear , Dorsey said the team is considering Bryant , who is looking for a fresh start . The 29-year-old developed into one of the league 's most physical receivers during eight seasons with Dallas . He had three seasons of more than 1,200 yards receiving and led the NFL with 16 touchdowns in 2014 . However , he came up short of living up to the five-year , $ 70 million contract he signed four years ago . Bryant battled an assortment of injuries before the Cowboys let him go to gain salary-cap space . Bryant has had some off-field issues , though nothing to Gordon 's level , and his fiery temperament led to some well-publicized sideline rants . But with Cleveland 's receiving corps reduced by Gordon 's absence and a season-ending neck injury to Ricardo Louis , the Browns may be willing to overlook any baggage . \" I look at Dez as a very competitive , passionate person , \" said Dorsey , who has known Bryant for years . \" That 's how I look at a Dez Bryant . \" NOTES : Rookie CB Denzel Ward signed his contract and reported in time for Thursday 's first practice . Ward was the last unsigned player in Cleveland 's rookie class . Top pick Baker Mayfield signed his $ 32 million deal Tuesday night . ... Dorsey and Jackson reiterated they will not rush Mayfield and that Tyrod Taylor is the club 's starting quarterback .

		"paragraph": "Wisconsin wide receiver Quintez Cephus announced Saturday that he will take an indefinite leave of absence from the team in order to focus his attention on fighting undisclosed criminal charges . The junior tweeted a statement in which he claimed he had been wrongly accused of unlawful conduct , though he did not say what specific charges he was facing . Cephus said the specific incident occurred in April of this year , that he has been under investigation for more than three months and the allegations were associated with what he claimed to be a consensual relationship . Not disclosing the specific crime is an unusual move for Cephus , who seems to be trying to get out in front of what could a very public saga , something the Big Ten has seen quite a bit this offseason . The consensual relationship language of his statement at least seems to narrows down the possible charges , but there is likely still an enormous amount of unknowns here . Wisconsin head coach Paul Chryst only offered a quick comment on Cephus while meeting with reporters later on Saturday , saying he met with the player and had advance knowledge that a statement would be released . Cephus missed Wisconsin s final five games of last season after undergoing surgery on his right leg , ending a breakout year with 501 yards and six touchdowns . He was expected to occupy the top spot in a talented receiving corps for the highly ranked Badgers , but it looks it will be Danny Davis , A.J.

		"paragraph": "MONZA , Italy ( AP ) For Ferrari , the wait continues . For Lewis Hamilton , it was a dream race . Hamilton won the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday after starting third on the grid to extend his championship lead over Sebastian Vettel following an opening-lap collision with the German driver that effectively ended his chances of victory . Ferrari had been hopeful of ending an eight-year wait for a win at its home track after taking the front two places on the grid at the Italian GP for the first time since 2000 . However , pole-sitter Raikkonen was overtaken by Hamilton eight laps from the end and the Mercedes driver held on , much to the disappointment of the passionate Italian tifosi fans . \" Today was so difficult . Whilst the negativity is never great , that 's what powered me along . I actually accept it , \" Hamilton said after getting roundly booed on the podium . Hamilton , who said he rated the win as among the top performances of his career , tied Michael Schumacher 's record of five Italian GP victories and extended his overall lead to 30 points over Vettel \" Disappointed but there was nothing I could do , \" said Raikkonen , who struggled with a tire problem in the final few laps . Hamilton 's teammate Valtteri Bottas was third , ahead of Vettel and Red Bull 's Max Verstappen , who received a five-second penalty . The 33-year-old Hamilton pinpointed the collision with Vettel as the decisive moment of the race . \" That was definitely a very , very key moment , getting past him was the immediate goal ... my race is not really with Kimi , it 's with Sebastian . However , I do need to get past Kimi at the same time , \" Hamilton said . \" Getting past Sebastian at the beginning was clearly a massive turning point . That definitely took a lot of pressure off ... I could just focus on Kimi for the whole race . We had a couple of good battles . \" Vettel had cut the gap at the top of the standings to 17 points with victory at last weekend 's Belgium GP . Hamilton put his rival under pressure from the start but Vettel pulled clear and was alongside Raikkonen into the first corner . Hamilton had another go on the outside heading into the second chicane , inching ahead of Vettel when they made contact , causing Vettel to spin and lose part of his front wing . The safety car was deployed and Vettel was forced into the pits for a new wing , coming out 18th . Both drivers complained on team radio but an investigation decided that no further action was necessary . \" Obviously I guess Lewis saw his chance but he did n't leave me any room so I got spun around and could n't avoid what happened , \" said Vettel . \" It could have been the other way , which would have been nicer for us , but was n't and I was facing the wrong way . \" We did well to come back given the damage that we had . \" There are seven races left on the calendar , including the Singapore GP on Sept. 16 on a track which suits Ferrari . \" There are many points to win back now in the championship , but we still have time to improve and we have the margin to recover , \" Vettel said . Moments after the safety car came in on lap four , Hamilton swiftly overtook Raikkonen on the straight but gave the lead back almost immediately at the second chicane . Meanwhile , Vettel was powering through the field and had made it back into the top 10 by lap 15 and was up to fifth nine laps later . But the German 's hopes of getting onto the podium were diminished when he was forced to make another pit stop and came out 10th . Raikkonen pitted from the lead at the end of lap 20 and came out fourth , behind Hamilton , Bottas and Verstappen . Hamilton waited until the end of lap 28 to come in for fresh tires , handing the lead to Bottas who was ahead of a charging Raikkonen . Hamilton emerged third and , with his teammate holding up Raikkonen , the British driver was able to close the gap . When Bottas eventually pitted at the end of lap 36 , the fight was on , with Raikkonen holding a one-second advantage over Hamilton . A few laps later Hamilton struck , coming around the outside of Raikkonen on turn one at the end of the straight to overtake the Finn and never looked back . Behind them there was a scrap for third place culminating at the first chicane when Verstappen appeared to move into Bottas , forcing the Finnish driver onto an escape road . Verstappen was furious when told he had been given a five-second penalty for his role in the incident on team radio , swearing and adding : \" They 're doing a great job of killing racing , honestly . \" More AP auto racing : https://apnews.com/tag/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP Sports",

		"paragraph": "President Obama ran his presidential campaign on the word hope , so it s only fitting that the Chicago Cubs were the final team to visit him in the White House before his final term comes to an end . After 108 years of hope , the Cubs finally made it to the White House to celebrate the team s World Series title . President Obama , who has not been secretive about his Chicago White Sox fandom during his presidency , admitted he enjoyed the Cubs run . Upon hearing this , the Cubs Twitter account had a little fun with that quote : Cubs President Theo Epstein even got in on the act , offering President Obama a midnight pardon for his White Sox fandom . With the President s rooting interests out of the way , the two sides managed to have a lovely ceremony . As a gift for inviting the club to the White House , the Cubs gave the President a number items , including a lifetime pass to Wrigley Field for his entire family . The 44th President of the United States also received a custom jersey from the Cubs own No. 44 , Anthony Rizzo . President Obama was also presented with some custom Jordans , courtesy of Dexter Fowler . Speaking of clothes , we would be remiss if we did n t mention some of the Cubs outfits for the event . Of all the combinations , Rizzo s red suit was a clear standout . Recently-retired Cubs catcher David Ross was also in attendance , and the President took the opportunity to note the similarities between he and the World Series winner . In Ross defense , his retirement party has come to an end . While his playing career is done , he will stick with the Cubs as a special assistant to baseball operations . With the Cubs last-minute visit to D.C. , Obama has hosted nine Major League Baseball teams at the White House during his presidency . The Philadelphia Phillies were the first club to visit Obama back in 2008 . The Cubs are the ninth and final team to visit the President .

		"paragraph": "Warning : This recap for the No Good Deed Goes Unpunished episode of Survivor : Game Changers contains spoilers . Survivor has been on somewhat of a hot streak the past few seasons . The franchise found a renewed energy , helped in large part by an improvement in the casting department . After a bad patch of heavy LA recruiting , the show returned to casting genuine fans of the show from a wider spectrum of backgrounds and locations . It made for a more dynamic , exciting , and engaging television show . It started with Second Chance , where for the first time ever , fans got to decide the cast , voting 20 of their favorite former players back onto the island for another shot . While the Second Chance season veered into meta territory at times , there was a palpable sense of passion amongst the returning castaways . Kaoh Rong followed , a season with a distinctly old school feel ( in the best possible way ) , choosing to focus on character over pure strategy . Last season s Millennials vs. Gex X silly theme notwithstanding was a perfect blend of the two , combining compelling characters with captivating gameplay . That hot streak is probably why Survivor : Game Changers has felt so empty and sluggish in comparison . The pre-merge purge of the biggest personalities , the deplorable and ugly Varner/Zeke situation , the dreary post-merge game where everyone looked like they d rather be doing anything else than playing this game for $ 1 million . Even when the episodes included interesting gameplay and surprise eliminations , it all felt rather hollow , leading to what is arguably one of the worst season finales in the show s history . Honestly , the season was flawed from the very moment they announced the theme and cast . The title , Game Changers , is so grandiose it was unlikely ever to meet the expectations the name evoked . The producers tried livening it up with countless twists and advantages , but it came off as a desperate ploy rather than entertaining TV . Then there was the cast itself a hodgepodge of Survivor legends and also-rans that never quite looked right on paper and even less so when they got out on the island together . Three of those names that raised eyebrows when the cast was first revealed were Sarah Lacina , Brad Culpepper , and Troyzan Robertson ironically , the Final 3 of Survivor : Game Changers . That kind of sums up the season and this soul-sucking season finale . Sarah had a relatively large presence in pre-merge Cagayan , but she s not a Game Changer in the same way as a Tony or a Sandra are . As for Brad and Troyzan , fans had previously made their opinions on the pair clear by refusing to vote them onto Second Chance . That s not to say Sarah did n t deserve her win . She s played a commanding game , ruthless when necessary but maintaining strong enough relationships where people felt an emotional connection with her even after she d betrayed them . As she tells the jury , her background as a cop , working undercover , allowed her to switch her emotions on and off depending on the situation . Seven out of the ten jury members awarded Sarah for her badass moves and strong social play over the condescending Brad and the laughably non-existent Troyzan . Death by Default The tone of the finale is set early into the episode when Cirie , one of Survivor ‘ s most highly regarded strategists , is eliminated due to a technicality . In what has been described elsewhere as Advantaggedon , five of the six players wind up with immunity . Tai plays an idol for himself and another for Aubry , Sarah uses her Legacy Advantage , Troyzan brings out his idol , and Brad has individual immunity , meaning that Cirie is the only person not immune and therefore eliminated without even receiving a vote . Many things about this leave a bad taste in my mouth . Firstly , at its heart , Survivor is a game about using social adaptation and strategic maneuvering to convince people not to vote for you . Cirie has played a total of 121-days over her Survivor career , and never received a vote against her this season , not even at the tribal council that sent her home ! Having the game decided by a barrage of advantages and idols robs both the players and the viewers of the show s most interesting aspect . Secondly , there are simply too many advantages . Jeff Probst might hype this up as another groundbreaking SURVIVOR FIRST ! but watching player after player stand-up and reveal their Twisty McTwisty Power as if it was Show and Tell in junior high is silly , not shocking . It was like a parody of the Second Chance final six tribal council , where Jeremy Collins and Kelley Wentworth both played idols , nullifying all the votes against them and creating a no-vote situation . But that moment felt organic and earned it was two idols out of only four that existed all season . In comparison , let s list all the advantages we ve seen throughout Game Changers : - Legacy Advantage - Troyzan Idol - Tai Idol # 1 - JT Idol - Tai Idol # 2 - Tai Idol # 3 - Extra Vote - Vote Steal That s on top of the three tribe swaps and the surprise double tribal and other insane twists cooked up in the minds of some particularly bored producers . It s too much . All it does is water down the product and turn tribal council into a crapshoot rather than an intriguing game of interpersonal dynamics and social strategy . Cirie may have got her praise from Probst and a standing ovation from the jurors , but I ca n t help feeling that she deserved better . It s not the first time twists have screwed Cirie , Survivor has been tough on her over the years . She was knocked out via a fire-making challenge in Panama one vote before the end , in Micronesia she d made the Final 3 only for a surprise Final 2 twist to send her home , and in Heroes vs. Villains , she was idoled out with only three votes against her . I d say let s hope for a fifth attempt , but she d probably make it to the end only to be told people ca n t vote for anyone whose name begins with a ‘ C this season . Brad the Bully The rest of the finale is dragged down by the reemergence of egomaniacal Brad Culpepper of F**k You Brad Culpepper fame . The same Brad that was hounded and called out by his cast mates in Blood vs. Water for his bullish and dictatorial behavior . Those aspects have been well hidden this season , leading to many people calling Brad misunderstood that he was a good guy all along and it was just the edit that painted him in a negative light . But with each immunity challenge Brad wins and he wins all three this episode , taking his overall total to five and tying the individual season record the more his nasty side begins to emerge . The majority of his vitriol is reserved for Tai , who he tries bullying into giving up his idols and then later ordering him to vote his way . It s not just a stressed man at an intense point in the game , there is malice behind his words , as he later shoots down Troyzan s suggestion of letting Tai know they re voting him out . I want him to suffer , Brad says , holding some weird grudge against Tai for betraying him , despite Tai saving the alliance pre-merge and Brad voting for Tai himself a few episodes back . You re treating me like a little child , like a simpleton , Tai tells Brad . It s true , the way Brad speaks to Tai is incredibly condescending . Unfortunately , with Brad hogging all the immunities , we have to watch him stomping around , declaring It s my island now ! as if he was trying his best Troyzan in One World impression . It gives Tai and Aubry little room to maneuver , their best option being persuading Sarah to vote Troyzan , but given Sarah has a much better chance of winning sitting next to Troy , we all know the result . Aubry and Tai are eliminated in fifth and fourth place respectively . Cop A Million Sarah is the benefactor of Brad s ego and poor social game . Despite Sarah being the clear favorite to win in front of the jury , Brad convinces himself that he s unbeatable regardless of who he sits next to , and when he votes out Tai based on spite , he buys his ticket to the Woo Hwang/Colby Donaldson club of dumb finalist decisions Meanwhile , Sarah has been crafting her relationships carefully , reminding Tai that she s cared for him the most out of anyone in the game . It s hard to tell when Sarah is genuine or not because the intonation in her voice never changes . Whether it s true or not , people believe her , right up until she votes them out . She takes a big risk by voting Tai , rather than putting a vote on Troyzan and forcing a tie she must have been very confident that Brad and Troyzan were voting Tai , because that could have easily been her having her torch snuffed . Once Sarah gets in front of the jury she shines , especially under this new format . Probst informs everyone that the jury questioning will work a little differently this season , rather than each juror standing up to deliver a question/speech , instead , an open discussion will take place structured around the concept of Outwit , Outplay , and Outlast . This allows each juror to fire back and forth multiple questions to the three finalists ( well mainly to two of them , no one cares about Troyzan ) , discussing their decisions in deeper detail that in the past . There are elements of this new jury format that I like it definitely provides a more detailed debate , not just between the jurors and the finalists , but between the jurors themselves . The troubling aspect is how Probst is controlling this like he would a regular tribal council . Usually at the Final Tribal Council , at least in the version we re shown on TV , Probst is relatively hands-off , just announcing when each jurors turn is up . In this format , he gets to direct the conversation , changing the way it s heading if he sees fit . It seems clear this was thought up because Probst is still shedding tears over the Kaoh Rong jury crowning Michele Fitzgerald over Aubry . However , in either format , I think Sarah had this locked up . While there are some hurt feelings , especially from Andrea , about how Sarah used her relationships to get ahead , the overall vibe from the jury is that Sarah was a badass , in Zeke s words . Her cunning move of voting out Sierra and still getting her to will the Legacy Advantage to her is heralded as a defining moment , and Sarah adds to this badassery by revealing she also snatched the Vote Steal advantage right from under Michaela s feet . When Aubry asks , What allows you to separate the game and the personal ? Sarah explains that her career as a cop gave her those skills . Brad has support from Ozzy , obviously , who respects him for his impressive physical game , and Debbie , who defends Brad s aggressiveness by saying that his testosterone level is 100 times the average male . But he comes under fire from Andrea and Tai for the way he speaks to people , his condescending attitude , and his poor social game , expertly exposed when Michaela asks him how much he knows about her life he knows no more than what he probably read off a bio sheet . Troyzan , realizing the way the wind is blowing , says that he s just happy to have made Day 39 and got to share this experience on the show he s loved since season one . It d be a nice sentiment coming from most people , but this is Troy , who has had more action blocking people on Twitter this season than he has in the game , yet still thought he was the favorite to win . Ultimately , the jury awards Sarah the title of Sole Survivor and the $ 1 million prize in a 7-3-0 vote . The cop that said she wanted to play like a criminal lived up to her promise , literally lying and stealing her way to the money . It s the best outcome of this particular final three , but not a finale that will be remembered fondly overall and certainly not one that was game changing . That s it for another season of Survivor . Thanks for reading these recaps each week , we ll be back for Season 35 Heroes v Healers v Hustlers ( oh boy ) .

		"paragraph": "New York Mets prospect Tim Tebow appears to be on the fast track . Despite a rough line in Class A , the 29-year-old was moved up a level following Sunday s game . The move was met with some criticism . Tebow was n t exactly tearing it up with the Columbia Fireflies , hitting just .220 / .311 / .336 , with three home runs , over 224 plate appearances . After 64 games , the Mets decided he was ready for the next level . By comparison , Bryce Harper played nine more games in the same league before the Washington Nationals moved him up . Because of that , Tebow s promotion was probably more about the money . The Mets realized they could profit off selling Tebow merchandise with a new team . People want to see him play , and the Mets took advantage of that . It also means that Tebow could move through the organization a lot quicker than expected . If the Mets keep Tebow on the same track , it s possible he could wind up in the majors before the end of the season . If you feel strongly about that , you are more than welcome to place your hard-earned money on it . Bovada has released odds on how high Tebow will move through the organization this season . If you think you know whether Tebow is bound for the Mets , you could make a significant profit . As you can see , the odds do n t just focus on the majors . You can also bet on whether Tebow will appear in Double-A or in Triple-A this year . So , which way are you leaning ? The Mets were pretty quick to promote Tebow despite some shaky stats , and could continue to do that all year . At 29 , he s older than the normal prospect , so the team could be aggressive with him . On top of that , the Mets are 34-41 , and could use Tebow as a September attendance boost if fans start to lose interest . On the other hand , it s not going to get easier as Tebow moves up . If his numbers take a dive as he faces tougher competition , the Mets could pump the brakes on the experiment . If they truly care about his development , the best thing for both sides would be to let Tebow stay at one level until he figures things out . If we were a betting site , we would … you know what , we re not a betting site , so we wo n t tell you how to spend your hard-earned gummy bears . If you re going to do so , we just ask that you place your bets legally . It s what Tebow would want .

		"paragraph": "President Trump s trade war may be more an act of desperation than aggression . Art Laffer , an advisor to President Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign , said on Friday that the president told him personally that tariffs were about all the leverage he has in his battle with China . He s said to me personally that he has very little leverage except by threatening tariffs and I have to trust him that he s telling me the truth , Laffer told Yahoo Finance . Trump reportedly is planning to push ahead with tariffs on $ 200 billion of additional Chinese imports to the United States as early as next week . The U.S. has already imposed tariffs on $ 50 billion of Chinese goods and China has responded in kind with tariffs on $ 50 billion worth of goods it imports from the U.S. Companies and members of the public have until Sept. 6 to submit comments on the proposed duties , which cover everything from selfie sticks to semiconductors and would impact significantly more consumer items than the previous tariffs had . According to the report , the president plans to impose the tariffs once that deadline passes . U.S. stocks fell after reports of Trump s intentions . In a wide-ranging interview with Yahoo Finance , Laffer , the architect of the supply-side economics paradigm embraced by former President Ronald Reagan , said that despite having started the trade war by imposing tariffs on the world s second largest economy , he believes Trump wants free trade . I believe deep down that he s a free trader , Laffer said . Any owner of an international business has to be a free trader if they know how to do business and he does . Laffer is known for the eponymous Laffer Curve , which suggests that reducing taxes can actually increase government revenue by spurring productivity among workers who are discouraged from labor by high tax rates . He s also known as a strong advocate for free trade , who has railed against tariffs and other non-tariff barriers to free trade . Laffer said a trade war would be the exact opposite of what he d like to see . That is the one thing we need to make sure we avoid , and free trade is the only real answer , Laffer said . The question is how do we get from here to there and that s not my specialty .

Jameis Winston ‘ s ban means Fitzpatrick is in line to start at least the first three games of the 2018 season for the Buccaneers . I mean , I thought I had seen and been through it all but another year , just another different situation , Fitzpatrick said , via the Tampa Bay Times . With games against the Saints , Eagles and Steelers on tap in the first three weeks , the Bucs will need to be sharp right out of the gate if they are going to avoid hamstringing themselves in the standings . Fitzpatrick said he is n t looking that far ahead , but will be counting on his teammates to help carry the load once they do get to the regular season . I mean , the season has n t even started yet , Fitzpatrick said . It s a clich . It s one game at a time but you have to look at it that way . Not even based off last year talent wise , looking at the team we have out here , I get in that huddle on offense and I mean , it s a pretty exciting huddle to be in as a quarterback looking at some of those guys . Fitzpatrick went 2-1 as a starter for Tampa last season . That was his 10th straight season making at least three starts in a season he also made three starts for the Rams in 2005 before that streak started and the Bucs are the seventh team that Fitzpatrick has started that many games for in a single season . None of that should have any bearing on how he fares this year , but it does support the notion that there is n t much Fitzpatrick has n t seen at this point of his career .",

		"paragraph": "Comcast s $ 65 billion bid for 21st Century Fox ( FOX ) is the largest all-cash offer in history , but analysts overwhelmingly are expecting the Walt Disney Co. to top it . Equity analysts and market watchers say that Disney has room to increase its bid and given chief executive Bob Iger s proclivity for dealmaking they expect the company to do just that . We believe Disney ( DIS ) has the flexibility to sweeten its current deal with cash , UBS analyst John C. Hodulik said in a note with the bank s equity team to clients . Disney does have a stronger balance sheet and higher stock valuation than Comcast . Comcast ( CMCSA ) holds more debt or leverage on its balance sheet than Disney , the analysts note , even though Comcast currently trades at five times its earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) , the analysts note , which they call a historic and absolute low . ( EBITDA can be used to analyze and compare profitability among companies and industries as it eliminates the effects of financing and accounting decisions . ) A deal with either Comcast or Disney would involve the buyer taking over Fox s cable networks , its international holdings , regional sports networks like Fox Sports Southwest and its film studio . The Fox News and national sports networks , which have been called the Murdoch family s crown jewels , would be spun off and remain under the family s control . At stake is a deal that would create a global content and distribution company , with leading platforms in the U.S. , Europe and India . With Fox s assets , the UBS analysts estimate Comcast would generate around 55 % of its pro forma EBITDA from U.S. cable , followed by 37 % from media and 8 % from Sky . It would also significantly increase Comcast s international exposure . Bloomberg Opinion columnist Tara LaChapelle says both the Murdochs and Disney clearly want the merger to take place and seem committed . Disney has a five-day window during which it has the right to match Comcast s offer . I suspect it will add some cash to its offer mix if that s what it will take to win a shareholder vote come July , LaChapelle said in an opinion piece . Disney is already six months into this deal and to some degree , both sides have already been talking about it as if it s in the bag . Oppenheimer analysts Timothy Horan and Tom Shaughnessy similarly expect a rejoinder from Disney , they said in a note titled Comcast Makes Formal Fox Offer Disney Likely to Top the Bid of Last Remaining Major Content Company . Both potential acquirers are seeing increases in their share prices . Disney s stock was up 2.4 % in pre-market futures trading Friday , having gained 4.2 % from its market close on Monday to its close on Thursday . Comcast s stock jumped 4.2 % in futures trading Friday , having gained 5.6 % between its Monday and Thursday close . While the company may not want to see Fox s assets slip through its fingers , Disney outbidding the cable giant could be a good thing , argues Moody s lead analyst Neil Begley . He rates Comcast s current $ 65 billion bid as credit negative . The total pro forma debt for the combined companies would be approximately $ 170 billion of total debt , the world s second-most indebted company ( excluding financial institutions and government-related entities ) after pro forma AT&T - Time Warner once it closes , Begley said in a statement . Assuming about $ 40 billion of EBITDA after synergies , pro forma leverage would be about 4.25 times , which represents a material change in financial risk tolerance for Comcast ‘ s AAA longterm debt ratings .

		"paragraph": "WASHINGTON ( AP ) The White House is brushing aside threats by Saudi Arabia that it may economically retaliate for any U.S. punitive action imposed over the suspected murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi , pledging a \" swift , open , transparent investigation \" into his disappearance . Two leading Republican senators said Congress stands ready to act , including a possible halt of military sales , if President Donald Trump does n't . White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow declined to speculate on what Trump might do after the president promised \" severe punishment \" in a \" 60 Minutes \" interview , if the U.S. determines that Khashoggi was indeed killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul . On Sunday , the oil-rich kingdom suggested retaliation if the U.S. were to impose strict measures . Trump has said he does not want to halt a proposed $ 110 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia because , he maintained , it would harm U.S. manufacturers . \" We will take stern action with the Saudis if necessary , \" Kudlow said . \" The United States is the dominant energy player so we 're in pretty good shape , in my opinion , with our energy boom to cover any shortfalls . We 'll wait and see , but rest assured that when the president says we will take actions if we find out bad outcomes , he means it . \" Kudlow also said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would be attending a Saudi conference this week to address terrorist financing , but those plans could change as details of the investigation become available . \" The president several times said we want a prompt , swift , open , transparent investigation , \" Kudlow said . Sens. Marco Rubio and Jeff Flake , members of the Foreign Relations Committee , said Congress was prepared to move quickly and firmly if Trump failed to adequately respond to the Oct. 2 disappearance of Khashoggi , a Washington Post contributor who had written columns critical of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman . Rubio said U.S.-Saudi relations may need to be \" completely revised \" and stressed the U.S. would lose credibility on human rights if the Trump administration remained silent . He also said Mnuchin should skip the Saudi conference . \" I do n't think any of our government officials should be going and pretending it 's business as usual until we know what 's happened here , \" said Rubio , R-Fla . Rubio declined to rule out a halt to the arms sales , stressing that the U.S. must send a message to repressive governments worldwide , from Russia to Syria and China . \" There 's not enough money in the world for us to buy back our credibility on human rights if we do not move forward and take swift action , \" Rubio said . \" Arms sales are important not because of the money but because it also provides leverage over their future behavior . \" Flake said if the Saudis did , in fact , kill Khashoggi , Congress might specifically curtail U.S. military aid to Saudi-led forces in Yemen . Saudi Arabia is leading a coalition of Gulf states in a military campaign against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen . The U.S. provides weaponry , intelligence and logistical support for the bombing campaign . \" I do think that arms sales will be affected . Certainly our involvement in Yemen with Saudi Arabia will be affected , \" said Flake , R-Ariz . More than 20 Republican and Democratic senators instructed Trump last week to order an investigation into Khashoggi 's disappearance under legislation that authorizes sanctions for perpetrators of extrajudicial killings , torture or other gross human rights violations . The writer had been living in self-exile in Virginia for the past year . The lawmakers ' letter was a preliminary step under the Global Magnitsky Act toward taking punitive action . Sen. Bob Corker , R-Tenn. , who as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has reviewed the U.S. intelligence into what happened to Khashoggi , has said , \" The likelihood is he was killed on the day he walked into the consulate . \" Turkish officials say that they fear Saudi agents killed and dismembered Khashoggi after he entered the consulate and that they have audio and video recordings of it . The kingdom has called the allegations \" baseless \" but has offered no evidence the writer left the consulate . Trump visited the kingdom on his first overseas trip as president and has touted arms sales to Saudi Arabia . Prodded Saturday to specify what type of \" severe punishment \" he could impose , Trump demurred . \" Well , there are many things we can do . Would you like to speak up about that ? \" he said , turning to Sen. James Lankford , R-Okla. , who was at the White House for the arrival of American pastor Andrew Brunson , who was released from Turkey after nearly two years of confinement . \" I do n't want to put you on the spot , but if you guys would like to tell them some of the many things we can do . There 's a big list . \" Lankford responded : \" Yeah , there 's a big list . Obviously , we have a long-standing partnership with Saudi Arabia in a lot of areas . \" He added , \" Let 's find out what did happen first . \" Rubio appeared on CNN 's \" State of the Union , \" NBC 's \" Meet the Press \" and CBS ' \" Face the Nation , \" Flake spoke on ABC 's \" This Week , \" and Kudlow also was on ABC and \" Fox News Sunday . \"",

		"paragraph": "NC State coach Dave Doeren had a few gripes after his team s 38-31 home loss to Clemson over the weekend . For one , Doeren said he wished the officiating in Saturday s game was better . He was n t the only one . A bunch of NC State fans let the officials have it as they left the field at Carter-Finley Stadium . It got pretty ugly with some fans throwing objects and apparently spitting on the officials , and now university police is investigating the matter . University police issued the following statement Monday : On top of that , after speaking about the officiating , Doeren , unprompted , brought up a laptop being used on Clemson s sideline . I d like to know why there was a laptop on Clemson s sideline that people were looking at , Doeren said . I d like that to be investigated . Maybe they were n t doing anything , but I was told it s illegal to have technology on the sideline . So I d like to know that as well . According to the Raleigh News & Observer , Clemson said the laptop belonged to its social media team and was not used for coaching purposes , which would have been illegal . The laptop was removed in the second half after the ACC was made aware of its presence on the sideline . From the News & Observer : On Sunday , an ACC spokesman told the Associated Press that the league was satisfied with Clemson s explanation . The Wolfpack led 21-17 at halftime but Clemson came back and won 38-31 . NC State looked like it was poised to tie the game late in regulation after advancing to the Clemson four-yard-line on a fourth-down conversion in the final minute , but the play was called back because of a ( correct ) illegal motion penalty . As you can see below , a few NC State receivers were not set at the snap . On NC State s second fourth-down try , quarterback Ryan Finley was intercepted and Clemson subsequently held on for the win . The loss dropped NC State to 6-3 on the season and gave the Tigers a commanding lead in the ACC Atlantic Division . A win over Florida State will clinch a division title and another trip to the ACC title game for Clemson . Sam Cooper is a writer for the Yahoo Sports blogs . Have a tip ?

		"paragraph": "He did n t know that I could hear them , and I could n t tear my attention away from their private conversation . Do you know what makes you even more special than the baby in mommy s tummy ? my new husband asked my 6-year-old son , who was sitting on his lap . Because I m your best buddy ! he exclaimed , throwing his arms around my husband s neck . Yes , you are ! my husband chuckled back . You are my buddy , and what makes you extra special to me is that your baby brother is being born into our family , but I picked you to be mine . I met you when you were 4 , and I took a good long look at everything that makes you who you are , and I said to myself , ‘ I want to be his daddy , because that s how much I love him . Forever and ever and ever , you re mine , because out of all the little boys in the whole wide world , I picked you . Six months pregnant with my new husband s first biological child , I had tears streaming down my face as I listened to him assure my son his stepson that even though a biological child was on the way , he would never be a step down . Even though he was a little boy whose own biological father my now ex-husband had punched him in the face , and then abandoned him , myself , and my daughter . My children have never seen him again , and for a long time my fiercely protective heart kept men away . Filling the father role was n t something I was seeking to do after so much hurt had been caused by the last one . So instead , I d send my daughter off to the daddy-daughter dance with the husband of a friend , and cheer alone at my son s preschool performances . And when my daughter would cry herself to sleep asking why no daddies wanted to love her , I would remind her that I loved her more than all the daddies in the world . My children were too special , and too precious , for me to settle for anything less than everything . And I was convinced that everything did n t exist . How could anyone love my children as much as I , their own flesh and blood , loved them ? But when I least expected it , he came along . And before I knew it , the officiant was pronouncing us not husband and wife , but a family . My daughter now wears a necklace engraved with The Day I Became Your Dad , and my son can no longer remember a time before my ( new ) husband was here . When my daughter is sick , he sleeps on the floor next to her bed . When she needs ridiculously expensive gluten-free play dough for school , he is the first to whip out his credit card , despite my protests about the price . In fact , when my son was diagnosed with epilepsy that required tens of thousands of dollars in treatment , he never flinched at the bills coming in because , as he told me , we take care of our kids . Right now , he s at karate , cheering on his son , because there are no stepdads in this family , there is only a dad that has stepped up . What we are going through is n t unusual . The word stepdad seems to support the idea that fathers who arrive a bit late are n t quite on par with biological fathers who were there first . But that could n t be further from the truth . There are plenty of examples of this in popular culture too . Matt Damon , stepfather to his wife s oldest daughter , Alexia , does n t refer to her as anything other than his daughter , despite the media being quick to point out the she is the sole stepchild of the couple s four children . It was even Alexia s biological father who pointed out that Matt treats Alexia like she is his own flesh and blood . And recently , country music star Blake Shelton told People magazine that becoming a stepdad to the children he shares with wife Gwen Stefani had shown him a part of himself that he never knew was there . It s definitely an instinct that kind of kicks in , he explained . It s easy to fall in love with those kids . They re pretty special . My husband and I have since given birth to our first shared biological son , who is now 3 months old . And recently I brought up something that had been weighing heavily on my heart since he was born : I asked if having a biological child had made him feel differently about the two children I brought into our marriage . Not one bit , he said without hesitation . Then he paused and added , Well , actually , yeah , it has . It s made me realize that I was always meant to be a dad to all three of them , because I could n t possibly love any of them more for being mine , or less because they did n t start out that way . I love them all like my own , just as I always have , and I always will . They are all mine . I know that I am no special snowflake when it comes to stepdads stepping up , and it s why I cringe every time that I hear someone refer to a stepdad as being not the real dad . What is a real dad , if not a man who steps up to care for children who need him ? There s no DNA test needed to be a dad to a kid who needs one in fact , there s no test required to become a dad to any children at all . Which is why this Father s Day , I ll be celebrating all dads but cheering a little bit harder for the stepfathers who have stepped up to be a dad to kids who may not have originally started out as theirs . Real dads show up the title s not important . Want to read more from Yahoo Lifestyle ?

At the time , he told The Daily Beast that he thought bringing the show back was n t a great idea because fans would want it to be exactly the same , and it wo n t be . And ultimately I think fans would be disappointed because it is n t exactly what they remember it being . Well , now the funny man has an idea for an Office 2.0 . I think ‘ The Office cast should get back together and reboot ‘ Cheers , Carell joked with Variety earlier this week at the premiere of his new real-life drama Beautiful Boy . I ll play Sam Malone and Rainn [ Wilson ] will be Frasier Crane . Beautiful Boy is an Office reunion of sorts . Amy Ryan , who played Carell s character s love interest HR rep Holly Flax on the series , portrays his ex-wife in the film , while Maura Tierney is his current spouse . Ryan said she d be up for a reunion : Why not ! That would be a good party . She imagined that Holly would likely be at a trade show or selling some crafts today . Tierney guest starred as James Spader s character s wife and said she hoped the character would at least have a job right now . In July , John Krasinski told Variety that he would love to reprise his role as Jim .

		"paragraph": "Fear the Walking Dead returns from its midseason break on Sunday with a strong episode that also suggests the weaknesses of the series . Titled Grotesque , most of the hour follows young Nick ( Frank Dillane ) as he inches across Mexico , smeared in blood and separated from his mother , Madison ( Kim Dickens ) , and sister , Alicia ( Alycia Debnam-Carey ) . The hour , written by Kate Barnow and directed by Dan Sackheim , is a clever addition to barren-landscape pop culture ranging from No Country for Old Men to The Last Man on Earth . Nick struggles , he starves , he tries everything imaginable to slake his thirst ( two words : cactus , urine ) , and he encounters what else ? a bunch of zombies . There are also a few desert-trek-inspired flashbacks that fill us in on some of Nick s family history and his drug-addicted past . Nick does n t talk much , since he s alone a lot of the time , and that s always a blessing in the Walking Dead franchise , where any dialogue between two characters can lead , without warning , to gusty windiness . Related : ‘ Fear the Walking Dead EP Previews Nick s Solo Adventure Which indeed occurs in the following week s episode , as we rejoin more of the show s characters . The tendency of Dead characters both here and in the flagship show , The Walking Dead to turn any conversation into a monologue or an opportunity to impart something that sounds like hard-won wisdom but , upon examination , dissolves into banality , returns with a vengeance . One I m - not-spoiling-anything character to another : The past it will make you sick . A bit later , this overripe line : What if your friend just became lunch for no reason ? The series is adding a spiritual element to the zombie apocalypse with the notion expressed by a rather mysterious pharmacist that those who have survived thus far are somehow chosen to endure . Recently , I was flipping channels and came upon Gone Girl and got sucked in once again by director David Fincher s film based on Gillian Flynn s novel . The two performances I enjoy most in that movie are by Carrie Coon ( as Ben Affleck s tart-as-a-lemon twin sister ) and Kim Dickens ( as the flinty cop investigating the crime ) . I thought about Dickens as I watched the midseason premiere of Fear the Walking Dead , glad as always that she must be making a handsome salary laboring in this franchise , but wondering whether she finds it as tedious as a performer as I do as a viewer . Dickens s Madison does a lot of squinting into the distance on Fear the Walking Dead , as though her character is always looking for a way out . I can identify .

		"paragraph": "By Steve Gorman and Daniel Trotta ( Reuters ) - A Florida sheriff came under mounting criticism on Sunday for his deputies ' response to this month 's deadly high school shooting and potential warning signs as dozens of state lawmakers called for his ouster and the governor ordered an independent inquiry . Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel insisted that only one of his armed deputies is so far known to have been at fault for staying outside the school while it was under attack rather than entering to confront the gunman who shot 17 people to death . That deputy , identified as the school 's assigned resource officer , Scot Petersen , has resigned rather than face suspension and possible dismissal after his actions were caught on video during the massacre , the sheriff acknowledged last week . News outlets including CNN and NBC have since reported that at least three more armed Broward County sheriff 's deputies were present on the scene , taking cover behind their vehicles instead of immediately going into the school . Israel sought to dismiss those reports , based on unnamed sources from the neighboring Coral Springs Police Department , which also responded to the shooting . \" Our investigation to this point shows that during this horrific attack , while this killer was inside the school , there was only one law enforcement person , period , and that was former deputy Scot Peterson , \" Israel said in a CNN interview on Sunday . Israel did not rule out , however , that the investigation could find other deputies who failed to act properly during or immediately after the Feb. 14 rampage , which authorities said lasted about six or seven minutes . The sheriff said separately on Twitter that he welcomed an investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement , as requested by Governor Rick Scott , to examine the response by local police and the sheriff 's office . \" This independent , outside review will ensure public confidence in the findings , \" Israel said . Fourteen students and three adult educators were slain when a gunman opened fire with a semiautomatic AR-15-style assault rifle inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland , an affluent suburb of Fort Lauderdale . Nikolas Cruz , a 19-year-old former student who was expelled last year for disciplinary problems , was later arrested and charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder . Authorities have said Cruz made his getaway moments after the shooting by blending in with students fleeing the school and was later apprehended after strolling through a nearby Walmart store and stopping at two fast-food outlets . The sheriff rejected calls for his removal as politically motivated and defended his department from criticism that his deputies overlooked a number of telltale signs that Cruz posed a threat of violence . \" I can only take responsibility for what I knew about , \" Israel , a Democrat , told CNN , adding that he had \" given amazing leadership \" since he was first elected sheriff in 2012 . Besides Peterson 's resignation , Israel has previously said two other deputies have been placed on restricted duty pending an internal review of whether they properly handled two telephone tips - from 2016 and 2017 - warning that Cruz was collecting weapons and might be inclined to commit a school shooting . The sheriff told CNN on Sunday that 16 other \" calls for service \" his department received about Cruz before the massacre were properly handled . Others disagreed . A letter on Sunday signed by 74 Republican members of the Florida House of Representatives urged Scott , also a Republican , to suspend Israel under a provision of the state constitution that lets the governor remove a sheriff for \" malfeasance , misfeasance , neglect of duty [ or ] incompetence . \" \" In the years leading up to this unspeakable tragedy , Sheriff Israel , his deputies and staff ignored repeated warning signs about the violent , erratic , threatening and antisocial behavior \" of the accused gunman , the letter said . It cited additional questions raised about the actions of the first deputies on the scene of the shooting . The Federal Bureau of Investigation also has drawn public outrage by acknowledging it failed to follow proper protocols after receiving a tip that Cruz possessed a gun , had indicated the desire to kill and could carry out a school shooting . FBI officials have told families of victims they \" deeply regret \" their mishandling of the matter . The carnage in Parkland , marking the second-deadliest U.S. public school shooting on record , has reignited an intense U.S. debate about firearms safety laws , with Stoneman Douglas students emerging as national voices calling for gun control .

		"paragraph": "After several weeks of relative calm to kick off the summer , the markets this past week were awakened by a fresh scare out of Europe and some comments from the Fed . Trading volume and some volatility returned . And that was likely just a preview of what investors can expect in the coming week . Many of the biggest banks on Wall Street will turn in quarterly results that will provide some insight into how the slowly improving economy is translating to companies bottom lines . Among the big names on the earnings calendar this week : Citigroup ( C ) , Goldman Sachs ( GS ) , Morgan Stanley ( MS ) , JPMorgan ( JPM ) , Bank of America ( BAC ) . Yahoo Finance s Jeff Macke says the light volume we ve seen will show up in the banks results . What we re going to see is that trading volumes have plummeted , says Macke . The trading desks are a nightmare … I want to see how the stocks react . That s going to be the next big thing that Wall Street obsesses over next week . Whether or not it fundamentally matters or should be a surprise is almost beside the point . It s going to be the reaction . Yellen goes to the hill The other thing Wall Street loves to obsess over is the Fed and parsing every word every governor says about the state of the job market , the broader economy , inflation and any potential hint about when interest rates may begin to rise . Fed Chair Janet Yellen heads to Capitol Hill for two days of testimony before Congress Tuesday and Wednesday , and Wall Street will be watching and listening closely , especially after the minutes from the latest policy meeting sent stocks lower in the middle of this past week . Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Michael Santoli says Yellen s goal as always will be not to make any news . The focus for the markets will be a shift in the Fed s focus , according to Santoli . Right now , the focus has switched from the risks of the labor market being too sluggish and the downside risks to the economy in the U.S. to the risks of overconfident financial markets , he says . The Fed minutes have said that , yes , they re a little bit concerned that investors are a little overconfident about chasing after yield and potentially a little too secure in their outlook for the economic horizon , which is interesting because the Fed engineered both those things . But Santoli does not believe all that adds up to a change in Fed policy just yet . Strange behavior Another constant concern for the Fed is the consumer . This coming week will reveal how freely consumers have been spending , and on what , with a report on retail sales for June expected Tuesday morning . Yahoo Finance s Rick Newman says consumers have shown some strange behavior recently . Namely , spending on big-ticket items , such as cars , but passing up everyday purchases . Newman says that , while car sales have been strong , We keep hearing one retailer after another saying sales just are n t measuring up . We had the president of Wal-Mart North America saying : If jobs are coming back , it s not showing up in our sales . We ve got a lot of other retail CEOs saying : Why are n t they spending money ? So Tuesday will reveal where consumers have and have not been spending their money , and what that says about the state of the economy .",

		"paragraph": "The 49ers have not won in Kansas City since 1982 . OK , maybe it 's not as bad as it seems . After all , that streak consists of just four games . But the past three games have been Chiefs blowout victories of 44-9 in 1997 , 41-0 in 2006 , and 31-10 in 2010 . Arrowhead Stadium is considered one of the most difficult outdoor venues for opposing teams in the NFL . And things should be rocking on Sunday when second-year quarterback Patrick Mahomes makes his first start at home . Here are four 49ers who can help spoil what the folks in Kansas City expect to be a festive day . Foster returns to action on Sunday after missing the first two games of the season due to a suspension for violations of the NFL 's policies on substances of abuse and personal conduct . His presence should provide a boost to the 49ers , who got uneven play at the weakside linebacker spot during his absence . Foster is a dynamic playmaker who should help offset some of Kansas City 's speed advantage . Foster is likely to start , alongside middle linebacker Fred Warner , giving the 49ers a player who can range sideline-to-sideline to track down explosive running back Kareem Hunt . The 49ers also expect veteran linebacker Malcolm Smith to make his 49ers debut after missing all of last season with a torn pectoral and the first two games this season with a hamstring injury . The 49ers will undoubtedly find a way to get Smith on the field with Foster and Warner . The 49ers must match Kansas City 's big-play ability with some of their own . Veteran running back Alfred Morris is the grinder . Breida is the home-run hitter . Breida enters Sunday 's game as the NFL 's leading rusher with 184 yards on just 22 rushing attempts . In the 49ers ' 30-27 victory over the Detroit Lions last week , Breida accounted for 159 yards from scrimmage . His 11.4 yards per touch was the highest verage for a 49ers running back since Frank Gore averaged 11.7 yards per touch in game against Seattle in 2009 . The 49ers must establish their outside zone running game , which should help slow down the Kansas City pass rush in order to enable quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to make some plays down the field . The 49ers ' first two opponents have virtually ignored their receivers on the side of the field where Richard Sherman lines up . On the other side , Witherspoon has seen a lot of action . And that does not figure to change this week after he struggled in coverage against the Lions . Witherspoon is not 100 percent , as he nurses an ankle injury . But he the 49ers say he is expected to play . If he is cleared to play and he says he can play , he is held to the same standard as everyone else . Mahomes will test Witherspoon early and often . And if Witherspoon is not up to the task , especially in attempting to run with wide receiver Tyreek Hill , the 49ers will have to consider once against taking him off the field in order to give the team its best chance of coming out of Kansas City with a victory . Kittle had a big game in the opener at Minnesota , and it could have been a whole lot better . Last week , he was not a big part of the team 's game plan . This week , he might be needed to quickly beat man coverage in the middle of the field and make plays as Garoppolo and the 49ers ' offense will aim to quiet the boisterous crowd at Arrowhead Stadium . Garoppolo was sacked six times against Detroit , and a lot of the 49ers ' problems stemmed from the receivers ' inability to get open quickly . That is where Kittle must excel , in order to give Garoppolo quick and easy solutions to beat the pressure . Kittle has seven catches for 112 yards through two games to lead the team , and he might need to have a huge game for the 49ers to pull off the upset .",

		"paragraph": "Who said all the good movies come out in the fall ? At 2018 s halfway point , Yahoo Entertainment had no trouble coming up with 20 standout titles from the past six months . From Marvel-ous blockbusters to smaller-scale fiction and nonfiction stories , here are the best films we ve seen so far this year . 20 . Solo : A Star Wars Story Maybe it was a mistake to release Solo so soon after The Last Jedi , or maybe it was simply bad marketing ( and , no , it was n t the Soylo Boycott ) , but Han Solo deserved better than the box office he received . A fun , light adventure featuring everyone s favorite Wookie and his human , Solo dove deep into Star Wars lore and nostalgia , crafting the best version of Han Solo s origins . ( And we can say that with some authority , since we ve read all the Legends novels . ) Where Rogue One favored fan service and plot over consistent characters , Solo let its charismatic characters carry audiences along a pulpy adventure . There s a good chance we wo n t get a sequel , but we certainly would n t mind a Lando film starring Donald Glover . Adam Lance Garcia 19 . Three Identical Strangers This year s entry in the always popular stranger than fiction subgenre of documentaries recounts the unlikely story of Eddy Galland , David Kellman , and Bobby Safran , three separated-at-birth brothers who met one another for the first time as grown-ups . That s already a fascinating hook for a feature film , along with the fact that the reunited triplets rode the wave of early - 80s tabloid television to become media sensations . But the real story of Tim Wardle s impeccably paced account reveals itself midway through the narrative , as the brothers attempts to research their own origin story leads them down dark and in some cases tragic paths . Ethan Alter 18 . Game Night Thanks to a killer cast ( Rachel McAdams ! Jason Bateman ! Kyle Chandler ! Jesse Plemons ! ) and a rock-solid screenplay that they should teach in comedy screenwriting courses , Game Night is one of the most consistently enjoyable major studio comedies in recent memory . Right from its opening sequence , this tale of an ordinary game night that spins wildly out of control sets itself apart with a distinct visual style and clever camera trickery that never lets up . Also , the sight of McAdams singing karaoke into a loaded gun belongs on her career highlights reel . Brett Arnold 17 . The Endless Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead return to the stomping ground of their indie debut Resolution for a head-spinning supernatural/sci-fi drama about two brothers ( played by the writer-directors ) who decide to revisit the remote California UFO sex cult they abandoned years earlier . Such a premise might imply an ensuing tale of unspeakable horrors , but the filmmaking duo instead take the story in wholly unexpected directions , even as they ground their story in the believably prickly relationship of their sibling main characters , whose own frayed bond is central to the film s time-space convolutions . Like their prior efforts , it s risk-taking but confident genre cinema . Nick Schager 16 . The Rider Chlo Zhao s no-budget indie could almost be called a documentary because of the way it films non-actors in their native territory in South Dakota . But a more accurate description is that it s a dramatization of actual events that just so happens to star the people including former rodeo rider Brady Jandreau on whom the story is based . By any definition , The Rider is a beautiful and devastating account about what happens when people follow their dreams only to have them slip away for good . B.A. 15 . RBG Julie Cohen and Betsy West s illuminating look at Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg ( aka the Notorious RBG ) succeeds in both facets of its two-pronged approach : It celebrates the judge s long and groundbreaking career , and it provides a reverential look at how the Brooklyn native became a feminist ( and pop-culture ! ) icon . As a bonus , the hit doc is a charming love story between the tireless justice and her supportive late husband , Martin D. Ginsburg . This is a big year for RBG at the movies : In the fall , we ll see Oscar nominee Felicity Jones ( The Theory of Everything ) portray Ginsburg in the biopic On the Basis of Sex . Kevin Polowy 14 . Tully The creative forces behind the bold , bracing dark comedy Young Adult writer Diablo Cody , director Jason Reitman , and star Charlize Theron reunite for another searingly incisive dive into one woman s troubled psyche . Theron plays Marlo , a harried mother of three in desperate need of at least one good night s sleep . Enter the titular night nanny ( Mackenzie Davis ) , who helps Marlo get some rest while also awakening potent memories of what her life was like pre-parenthood . Cody s unnervingly unsentimental script deftly navigates fault lines that real moms and dads have almost certainly experienced , making Tully a difficult but ultimately cathartic watch . Just maybe not on Date Night . E.A. 13 . Deadpool 2 The first Deadpool was the surprise hit of 2016 , and the self-aware sequel does all it can to double down on everything its predecessor did , all while admitting to the audience , Yes , we know this is n t as good as the original , but let s be honest … what sequel is ? While the controversial opening scene of the film left a slightly sour taste in our mouths , Deadpool 2 finds its voice in Act 2 , thanks to the antagonistic team-up of Ryan Reynolds and Josh Brolin , who apparently is now required to be in every Comic Book Cinematic Universe . The movie also ends with what might be the most meta ( and best ) post-credits sequence we ve ever seen . A.L.G. 12 . You Were Never Really Here Joaquin Phoenix s collaboration with Scottish auteur Lynne Ramsay provides further proof that he may be the best American actor working in cinema today . As a haunted military veteran now working as a for-hire man-of-action capable of finding and rescuing missing young girls , the actor exudes volatile intensity and soul-deep hurt that works in perfect concert with Ramsay s efficiently expressionistic direction . You Were Never Really Here is violent not only literally but emotionally and builds toward nightmarish confrontations that are almost as bracing as its leading man s unforgettable performance . N.S. 11 . Hereditary Ari Aster s nightmare-inducing first feature is one of those heavily hyped festival debuts that you assume ca n t possibly be as great as everyone says it is . Except in this case , the movie delivers . While general audiences were thrown for a loop by the deceptive marketing ( resulting in the movie s D-plus Cinemascore ) , horror fans will love that the film is n t a typical jump-scare horror programmer . Instead , Hereditary is a movie about grief , family , and the inevitability of your genetics can you ever truly outrun what s in your blood ? Oh , yeah , and the third act is pure satanic insanity . B.A. 10 . Incredibles 2 It s not as incredible as its 2004 predecessor , but they ca n t all be Toy Story 3 . Brad Bird s long-anticipated Parr family reunion is , however , a worthy follow-up that starts just moments after the first and feels stylistically and tonally perfectly in tune with the original film . Bird and company counter the fact that the freshness of seeing an animated superhero family has waned with the emergence of Elastigirl ( Holly Hunter ) handling the bulk of the crimefighting while Mr. Incredible handles more domestic battles at home . The real star of the show , though , is Baby Jack-Jack . Give this tot a spinoff or , better yet , have him fight The Boss Baby . K.P. 9 . Annihilation Alex Garland is one of science-fiction cinema s most original and daring voices as evidenced by Annihilation , a film that begins in somewhat traditional territory before venturing off into uninhibited insanity . Grief-stricken biologist Natalie Portman joins a team of experts ( including Tessa Thompson , Gina Rodriguez , and Jennifer Jason Leigh ) on a trip into a hot-zone known as the Shimmer , where mutated horrors await . Garland imbues his hypnotic material with a heavy dose of profound existential dread , and the finale is so deliriously out-there that it achieves a measure of trippy 2001-grade terror and wonder . N.S. 8 . Blockers Here s a movie that fulfills its most necessary requisite of being uproariously funny no matter how high-concept it goes while also managing to remain socially relevant . As three parents ( the reliably amusing John Cena , Leslie Mann , and Ike Barinholtz ) embark on a midnight run to prevent their prom-going teenage daughters ( the excellent Geraldine Viswanathan , Kathryn Newton , and Gideon Adlon ) from losing their virginity , we re asked why females are held to such a different standard when it comes to their sexual awakenings . Come for the butt-chugging scene , stay for the touching coming-out story . K.P. 7 . Sorry to Bother You Rapper Boots Riley makes the leap to feature filmmaking without missing a beat . While the gleefully absurdist , and pointedly political , Sorry to Bother You which opens in theaters July 6 but has been playing the festival circuit since January displays the influence of wild social satires like Putney Swope and Being John Malkovich , it has its own distinct voice that speaks directly to our present day . With Get Out ‘ s Lakeith Stanfield as his muse , Riley deftly ( and hilariously ) explores the intersection between race , class , culture and power in Trump-era America , building to a final twist that you definitely wo n t see coming . E.A. 6 . First Reformed It may seem crazy to mention Paul Schrader s latest film , First Reformed , in the same breath as his seminal screenplay for Taxi Driver , but you d be hard-pressed to come up with a more fitting comparison when the credits roll . The story of a priest ( Ethan Hawke ) coming to terms with the world we live in , this small-scale story slowly builds to a shocking conclusion with devastating implications . It s Schrader s first full-fledged masterpiece of the 21st century and a hell of a left turn from the film that preceded it , his little-seen ( and totally crazy ) crime movie , Dog Eat Dog . B.A. 5 . Avengers : Infinity War Let s be honest , Infinity War is n t the best Marvel film , but it is , without a doubt , the MCU s crowning achievement … and not simply for breaking nearly every box-office record . After 10 years and 18 films , the Kevin Feige-led Marvel Studios successfully crafted a shared universe that allowed for Dr. Strange , Iron Man , and Spider-Man to plausibly team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy and fight Thanos . Whether the contractually questionable deaths at the end of the film worked for you or not depends of your ability to suspend your disbelief . But with the shape of the MCU fundamentally altered at least for the time being we left the theater wondering just how the Avengers will eventually save the day . A.L.G. 4 . Wo n t You Be My Neighbor ? Even in these divisive times , almost every American can agree that Fred Rogers is a gosh-darned national treasure . For more than three decades , the soft-spoken minister turned broadcaster entertained and educated millions of children through his iconic PBS series , Mr. Rogers Neighborhood . Director Morgan Neville traces the arc of Rogers s life with plenty of surprising revelations and a sweetly sentimental appreciation for the good works he performed on a daily basis . Bring tissues , because there will be tears . E.A. 3 . Paddington 2 It was true in January and remains true today : 2018 s finest sequel is Paddington 2 . Returning director Paul King resists the urge to force his gentle ursine star into a bigger , louder adventure , instead keeping Paddington ( voiced by Ben Whishaw ) and his adopted family grounded in a richly emotional story that makes room for plenty of veddy British humor , scene-stealing supporting turns from Hugh Grant and Brenden Gleeson , and inventive storybook-style visual tricks . Audiences may have slept on this gem during its stateside theatrical release , but it should enjoy a long afterlife as a children s bedtime movie . N.S. 2 . A Quiet Place John Krasinski s third directorial effort is his finest to date a supernatural thriller that exploits its central gimmick for lean , mean suspense . In an America ravaged by vicious monsters with excellent hearing , humanity must stay completely silent to remain undetected . That scenario is the starting point for the story of a family ( led by Krasinski and real-life wife Emily Blunt ) trying to survive in the aftermath of a horrific tragedy . Bolstered by excellent performances and a script that does n t overstay its welcome , A Quiet Place exploits sound and silence for consistent , canny scares . N.S. 1 . Black Panther Is Marvel s most successful movie yet also its very best ? Quite possibly . Ryan Coogler s stunning superhero drama transcends mere cinema , becoming not just a pop-cultural phenomenon but a full-on movement . As a film first , though , it s big , bright , bold , intense , awe-inspiring , evocative , and deeply profound , especially in its cultural clash between our hero T Challa ( Chadwick Boseman ) and Killmonger ( an Oscar-worthy Michael B. Jordan ) , the African-American mercenary whose barely contained rage , driven by the oppression of black people in the U.S. , makes him one of the most complex and tragic antagonists of our time . Wakanda forever . K.P. Read more from Yahoo Entertainment :",

Throughout the episode , Mr. Hankey had been sending out offensive , racist tweets , and he used Roseanne Barr s Ambien defense each time . In May , Roseanne s show was cancelled after she sent a racist tweet about a former Obama aide and blamed it on Ambien . But besides trolling Roseanne throughout , Trey Parker and Matt Stone took this opportunity to take a shot at The Simpsons for the show s controversial character , Apu Nahasapeemapetilon . Earlier this year , The Simpsons came under fire for the racial stereotyping of Apu , and the flippant way in which the producers handled the controversy . And in true South Park fashion , they poignantly let the audience know exactly why Mr. Hankey was going where he was . Right after Mr. Hankey took off , Stan asked Randy , Where will he go ? Randy replied , He ll have to find a place that accepts racist , awful beings like him . There are still places out there who do n t care about bigotry and hate . It s at that moment Mr. Hankey flies into Springfield with his signature , Howdy ho . Mr. Hankey was greeted by dozens of Simpsons characters including Apu , who was the first to welcome Mr. Hankey to town . South Park used #cancelsouthpark as a marketing scheme in the run-up to the season ( or maybe that s what they want but hopefully not ) , but after accusing The Simpsons of racism and bigotry , they changed it up and ended the episode with #cancelthesimpsons .

		"paragraph": "WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- President Donald Trump says insurers are \" going wild \" about his new health care options and \" millions and millions \" of people will be signing up . But insurance companies say it will take time to design new plans and get approval from state regulators , and two major industry groups have actually expressed concern about potential downsides for consumers . For people who need an individual policy and are anticipating cheaper plans this fall , the advice seems to be : Look carefully and read the fine print . Short-term , limited-duration insurance just approved and association health plans represent the Trump administration alternatives to comprehensive but costly policies under the Affordable Care Act . Both offer lower premiums than comprehensive health insurance but also cover less . The plans wo n't be sold through HealthCare.gov . Myra Simon of the industry group America 's Health Insurance Plans said consumers are likely to see advertising this fall for short-term plans but association plans may be harder to find , since they 're not open to everybody . Policyholders must have a common link , such as working in an industry like real estate . \" The short timeline may mean that this fall we are n't going to see all the products we are eventually going to see , \" said Simon , an expert on individual health insurance . \" We might see some more heavy marketing of products that already existed . \" Jeff Smedrud , CEO of Pivot Health , which offers short-term plans , says companies are behind the curve on updating their plans to account for the greater leeway provided by the Trump administration . He 's forecasting \" minor improvements \" in plans by October but \" a lot of change in 2019 . \" Strictly speaking , short-term and association health plans are not new . The Trump administration has broadened their potential reach , although some states may push back with restrictions . Short-term plans do n't have to take people with pre-existing medical conditions , or provide benefits like coverage for maternity , mental health , prescription drugs and substance abuse treatment . They can last up to 364 days and be renewed for up to 36 months . Association health plans do have to accept people with pre-existing medical conditions , but they do n't have to cover the full menu of 10 \" essential \" kinds of benefits required by the ACA . On the whole , association health plans have more federal consumer safeguards than short-term plans . Speaking at the White House last month , Trump almost made it sound like there 's going to be a stampede to get the new plans . \" So all of the insurance companies are going wild , they want to get it , \" he said of association health plans . \" You 're going to have great health care at a much lower price . \" As for short-term insurance , \" somewhat different , result the same , \" Trump said . \" Much less expensive health care at a much lower price will cost our country nothing . \" That 's not what the industry 's saying . The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association warned that \" the broader availability and longer duration of slimmed-down policies that do not provide comprehensive coverage has the potential to harm consumers . \" And America 's Health Insurance Plans , the main trade group , said , \" We remain concerned that consumers who rely on short-term plans for an extended time period will face high medical bills when they need care that is n't covered or exceed their coverage limits . \" Under the Obama-era health law , consumer complaints centered on high premiums , particularly for middle-class people not eligible for its income-based subsidies . But the fear of being turned down because of a pre-existing condition faded away . So did worries about being denied coverage for certain kinds of care , like substance abuse treatment . And insurers were forbidden from imposing annual and lifetime dollar limits on coverage . Now concerns about such fine print will be back , particularly with short-term plans . Some consumers may be willing to gamble , figuring that if they get sick they can always switch to comprehensive coverage at HealthCare.gov with an ACA plan . Not so fast , said Simon , the individual insurance expert . With some exceptions , people can only sign up for ACA plans during open enrollment season from Nov. 1-Dec . 15 . If someone in your family later gets diagnosed with a serious mental illness , for example , you might have to wait months to get them into a comprehensive plan that will cover that condition . \" It 's not simple to move back and forth , \" said Simon . Another potential surprise : Gary Claxton of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation says short-term plans may turn out to be more costly than Trump administration officials suggest . The plans now cover up to 90 days , but if insurers expand them to offer up to 36 months ' coverage , the companies will be taking on more risk . \" You 'll have to pay more up front because there 's a longer time during which you could get sick , \" Claxton said . That 's correct , confirmed Smedsrud , the insurance CEO . \" The longer you cover somebody , the more likely it is you are going to have a claim , \" he explained .",

		"paragraph": "The pro careers of Greg Oden and Jimmer Fredette did n t work out for very different reasons , but both were disappointing given college careers that were successful also for very different reasons . Oden in particularly remains one of the NBA s sadder stories in the long history of draft busts . One of the most talented big men college basketball has ever seen , the seven-footer carried Ohio State to the NCAA Tournament final as a freshman and was hyped as a generational NBA prospect , even more so than a young Kevin Durant . That hype did not work out . Instead , injury after injury swallowed Oden s career and saw him appear in just 105 career games . He eventually retired from the NBA in 2016 . However , Oden s basketball career is n t over . The now-30-year-old made his debut playing for the top-seeded Scarlet & Gray in The Basketball Tournament on Friday , posting 11 points and five rebounds in just 16 minutes of action . With his first basket , Oden showed his post moves were still there . Playing on a team composed of other Ohio State alumni , including Jared Sullinger and Aaron Craft , Oden seemed to be having the time of his life after his successful return to the court . Oden s next challenge will be a game that any college basketball fan should have circled on their calendar . Team Fredette , led by the former unanimous national player of the year , awaits in the Tournament s Super 16 . Fredette s NBA career never took off like some fans imagined the NBA was much better equipped than college teams to handle Fredette , a pure scorer with a shot selection that would make Steph Curry blush . The BYU great averaged just 6.0 points in his NBA career and , five years after being drafted 10th overall by the Kings in the 2011 NBA draft , he had landed with the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association . Fredette found his old scoring success in China , averaging a hair below 37 points per game , but now he s back playing in the U.S. and seeking the Tournament s $ 2 million prize on a team also featuring his old BYU co-star Brandon Davies .

		"paragraph": "UPDATED with video : Omarosa continued her march through NBC News programs this morning in support of her new book about her time in the White House , unveiling on Today show her December recording of President Donald Trump saying he did not know White House Chief of Staff Gen. John Kelly had fired her previous day . Omarosa , Omarosa what s going on ? I just saw in the news that you were thinking about leaving leaving . What happened ? someone sounding like Trump says in the recording Omarosa says she made the day after Kelly fired her from her position as White House director of communications in the office of public liaison , and had just heard about it in the news . General Kelly came to me and said that you guys wanted me to leave , O is heard responding . No . I had … nobody even told me about it . Nobody , Trump responds . You know , they run a big operation but I did n t know that . Dammit . I do n t love you leaving at all . NBC News does not know what was said before or after those comments in the recording , Savannah Guthrie made sure to tell viewers . Is he lying ? Guthrie asked of Trump s claim of ignorance . Omarosa wanted instead to talk about why she was stuck in the Situation Room for almost two hours and not allowed to leave , as Kelly was firing her and then turning her over to a team to walk through terms of her exit . She told Guthrie , as she had told Chuck Todd on Sunday Meet the Press that she had asked to leave and also asked to speak to her lawyer , and to her husband who she said was outside the room . On air , at least , no one from NBC News has asked Omarosa what her husband was doing outside the Situation Room . Omarosa also insisted Americans should be alarmed that the President of the United States is not aware of the employment status of a director of communications in the office of public liaison who first served him on The Apprentice 15 years ago . But Omarosa also told Guthrie she thinks Trump knew about her firing , saying he probably instructed Kelly to sack her so he could keep his hands clean when he spoke to me . So her comment is Gen. Kelly running this country or is the president running the country sounded more like bad script writing than ominous warning to the country . Omarosa also wanted America to know the White House still has personal stuff she had in her office and she wants it back . She also claimed White House had destroyed some of that stuff . She did not say what the stuff was , and Guthrie , who came prepared with a long list of questions , did not ask . Guthrie repeatedly tried to get Omarosa to stick the questions that were put to her , but O was having none of it , responding dismissively when Guthrie interrupted one of her meanderings , You ca n t ask a question and then ask another question without my answer . Omarosa wondered who is running the country when Donald Trump says ‘ they run a big operation . Is Kelly … running the country instead of the president ? Omarosa also mentioned it has been reported Trump lied about 4K times in the last year , and admitted she knew he was lying . Then why did you work for him ? Guthrie shot back . Savannah , slow down ! Omarosa responded condescendingly . I m going to answer your questions … . So you do n t have to ask 10 questions in one second . It s okay . That s known as running out the clock she had granted Today a 7 minute interview . Trump , she said , is known to be entertainer , to exaggerate . But I never expected him to lie to the country , Omarosa finally answered . I thought he would take his oath of office seriously , that he would be committed to advancing this country . He has an issue with the truth and sometimes he battles with reality , she asserted . Guthrie wondered how Omarosa allegedly taped Kelly in the Situation Room , firing her , given that it s one of the most secure places in the House House and you re supposed to leave your phone outside . It s the honor system Guthrie added , answering her own question . Omarosa , meanwhile , only said she would leave that to your imagination . Why be coy ? Guthrie asked . I m not being coy , Omarosa insisted stoutly in the face of fact . What does it say about Omarosa s integrity if she s taping Kelly in the Situation room and taping Trump etc. , Guthrie wondered out loud . Omarosa turned viewers attention to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders , who has called Unhinged , a pack of lies . She lies all the time , Omarosa scoffed . Clock ticking , Guthrie moved on to Omarosa s revelation to Todd on Sunday that she had actually heard the long-rumored tape of Trump allegedly using the N-word during production of the Apprentice franchise . O said what she heard was about three-minutes long , and is an audio tape . Guthrie asked another question about the content of the tape . I answered that question so what s the next question ? Omarosa sneered . The people who have this tape intend to release it , Omarosa promised us , suggesting a journalist ask Trump if he ever uttered that word . Book title refers to Trump , the author said when asked to clarify , explaining I do n t think he s fit and as you heard , he does n t even know what s happening in the White House . Kelly is running this White House and Trump does not know what is going on , Omarosa said , clearing up any uncertainty who she is really trying to take down .

I did n t understand the weight of the secret my mom had revealed to me , Arce , who is now a U.S. citizen , says of the revelation . Her journey from living in the shadows to a high perch on the corporate ladder has inspired an improbable career as a bestselling author and has changed lives . To me the word ‘ immigrant is really about strength . It s really about how much we give to America of our talents and our hard work to make the country better , Arce told Yahoo . Arce , who went on to become a VP at Goldman Sachs as well as an author , social advocate , and champion for higher education , came to Texas from Mexico on a tourist visa when she was 11 years old . At 14 , her visa expired . Arce s younger brother was born in the U.S. her parents still had visas but she was the only one who was undocumented . Everything about my life was about hiding this one fact about my life , making sure that no one found out , and so I learned how to hide . Her second memoir , Someone Like Me , which was released in September , is meant for young readers age 10 and up . The central theme : Arce s own American dream of going to college and overcoming the obstacles of her immigration status . I found myself saying , ‘ Someone like me can go to college , someone like me can become a Vice President at Goldman Sachs , and someone like me was not supposed to make it that far , but I did , she said . I remember being in middle school and never reading any books in school that reflected my experiences as a Latina , as a Mexican-American , as an immigrant , as a brown girl . Arce s first book , 2016 s My ( Underground ) American Dream , became a bestseller . She s working with actress America Ferrera to develop the book into a TV show . In 2012 , Arce started the Ascend Educational Fund to give students , regardless of their immigration status , a chance at higher education . Education is a human right . Every child , regardless of their ethnicity , deserves to have a quality education , she said . Arce has been able to award close to $ 500,000 in scholarships to more than 50 students .

		"paragraph": "According to research published in October , self-help apps are incredibly effective . Indeed , 90 percent of people surveyed in a Brighman Young University study reported that mental and emotional health apps make them feel increased motivation , confidence , intention , and attitudes about being mentally and physically healthy . With that in mind , it should come as no surprise that the startup Shine , which sends daily text messages of encouragement to its users , has amassed over 1 million subscribers since it launched in 2016 . It has also raised over $ 3.3 million in funding . Now , the team behind Shine has moved on to their next iteration : a wellness app . The app , which launched last week and is free to download ( and costs $ 4.99 per month for premium content ) , coaches users through problems via meditation and anecdotes and interactive features . It s filled with challenges , affirmations , advice , and of course those daily messages for which Shine first became known . The two women who started the company , Marah Lidey , 28 , and Naomi Hirabayashi , 34 , met while working together at the volunteer platform DoSomething . They say they started Shine because they wanted to provide a space for people to air the insecurities and thoughts they did n t feel they could bring elsewhere . Lidey says they also wanted to counterbalance the image we all project in the social media world . I m killing it , I m doing really well , I m making money , and having so much fun with my friends . Ca n t you see ? she says , imitating our online selves . The flip side to that , Lidey notes , is the reality that none of us really feel like that 24/7 , and for many of us , there is n t an obvious place to turn . That s where Shine comes in . The venture has been a success so far , and all signs point to the app being one as well . The women behind the mission are also seeing signs of success on a personal front , with Lidey landing a spot on the coveted Forbes 30 Under 30 list . The women sat down with Yahoo Lifestyle to answer a few questions about Shine , and they shared why they think the app should be the next addition on all of our phones . Yahoo Lifestyle : Where are you guys from ? Marah Lidey : Savannah , Ga . Naomi Hirabayashi : Fairfax , Va . Do you remember meeting each other ? Naomi : I walked up to Marah on her first day [ at DoSomething ] , she was wearing a red shirt , and I was like , ‘ Hi , I m Naomi . We did n t get a chance to meet when she was interviewing I was out that day and everyone was raving about her . When I met her I felt like I was meeting a celebrity . I just immediately felt comfortable . She s someone who is really engaging , someone you want to hang out with , to get to know , and also someone you feel like you ve known for a long time in a beautiful way . So that was our first meeting , that s how I remember it . Marah : When you start a new job , I talk about this a lot with friends , it s one of the hardest things in life , and people very much underestimate that . It just takes time to acclimate to anything new . So you start , and you feel like you re in someone else s skin . I was really excited about the big job I had gotten , but I definitely had the Am I doing this right ? feeling . What I loved about Naomi is that she made me feel like I was doing it right . She made me feel accepted and supersupported . In your early career , you are always looking for someone to give you validation and make you feel comfortable . Having another woman , and a woman of color , who was in an amazing leadership position was great . Naomi was also the person you wanted in every meeting she was incredibly thoughtful and strategic , but also very energetic and solution-oriented . Where did the idea for Shine come from ? Naomi : We actually launched Shine while we were working together at DoSomething . We had teamed up together on a project , and spent a lot of late nights together at work . It was on one of those late night when we were just talking , just [ emotionally ] leaning on each other and talking through things that were going on in our lives . We had felt for some time , like , I wish there was more of this . These conversations . When we looked at a lot of the wellness and well-being verticals that were out in the world , it felt like those conversations and the way we talked about what was going on in our lives were n t reflected . Everything we were seeing in the space felt very bougie , very much like something that you do when you have time for it , versus how we actually experience our well-being , which is every single day all the time . We took a step back and were like , what if we just sent a text ? Because that s what we did at DoSomething . We had scaled texting from 0 to 5 million and realized the power of it texts have a 98 percent open rate and we asked ourselves , what if we did texts , but for well-being ? We did a prototype for 50 people and sent it out . We also did weekly surveys for a month . It was the response to those surveys that very quickly made us realize that this was more than just a side project or a cool idea . It was actually something that was needed and that we needed to go forward with . What was the first text Shine ever sent ? Marah : It was about the feeling of being behind , and feeling like you re not where you re supposed to be , whether that s physically you re running late for a meeting or running behind on something ( we all know that sweaty , on-the-train feeling ) but also just feeling behind in life and that you have n t achieved what you should have achieved by now . It s a topic we still hit on a lot because it certainly still resonates . You have an idea and you re like , I want this for myself , and I know that it would resonate with me . I have no idea if it would resonate with other people , but let me just try it . And I m really proud of us for doing that because there s so much inertia in starting something , and there are so many good ideas that just get left on the table because we think it needs to be perfect . If we would have known that Shine would reach a million users and have all this success , then of course we would have started it even sooner . But I m proud of the fact that we were like , We do n t know , but we know texting like nobody else in the industry . We scaled it across the U.S. , U.K. Brazil , Mexico , Canada , five countries in Africa . We have a really clear understanding of what it looks like to globally launch and scale a really engaging experience that feels like a friend in your pocket . That felt like a really big differentiator . The first reaction that we got from people was holy s *** , I ca n t believe this did n t exist before . This is fundamentally changing my mood , I feel better on a daily basis . We had people starting Shine circles in the second week of our prototype , where they were essentially getting around the table with people that they work with and they d do a Shine break and talk through the theme of the day . Obviously that validation felt good , but it also made clear that there was so much more here . It very organically grew from there , until we were like , we ve got ta quit our jobs . We had to explore what was here . And did you raise money right then ? Naomi : We raised two rounds . We did n t go to business school . We had worked at startups , but obviously had n t spent a lot of time in the venture capital ( VC ) space . Looking back , we did n t realize how impressive and amazing it was that we were able to raise a round on the side . We had our full-time job , and we would take meetings at lunch . We d take our vacation days and go pitch . We were very transparent with DoSomething , and they were very supportive . We were so motivated by the response we were getting from the community to make this happen . Marah : In 2015 , when we started , there was not a lot of content about wellness , just in general . And if there was , it was very narrow-minded in terms of what people s experiences looked like . It was like , Do you have time to go on sabbatical or do a juice cleanse ? Some people have clearly doubled down on that , and there s a market for that . But there s also a huge market for people who YouTube influencers resonate with . The whole reason those people rose to fame is that they re normal , or more normal than the Photoshopped celebrities we are used to seeing , and they are in your room and in your kitchen and talking to you , in a way that just feels really accessible . If you think about how many people do n t get a text , sometimes in their morning or in their day living in big cities , like we do , you can normalize really quickly what social life is like , but for us , isolation and representation and making sure people did n t feel alone was so important to us . Coming into a VC pitch with that , you re definitely coming at someone who maybe has n t thought about this before , but I think the proof has always been in the pudding . When we show the traction we ve built and what we ve heard from our users , that helps get anybody onboard . Why should people download the app ? What can they expect from the app every day ? Naomi : It just makes it easier for you to take time for yourself in a way that works for your day . And that comes to life in the app in two ways . First you can get the Shine text , a daily message that makes it easier for you to work on your well-being , and it sounds like it s coming from a friend . It s not some intense thing that you have to digest and you re like , Oh , great . Here s another thing I do n t have time for . We ve put so much time and energy and passion behind making sure it feels really inclusive and reflects what the average day really looks like for people . It s quick and it s bite-sized and its actionable . The second thing you ll get are mindful moments , which are quick audio tracks , a modern take on meditation . Everything from advice on help , I have a toxic friend , to self-care and online dating , to beating burnout . But all done in a way that really talks to you like a friend . It s talking about these issues we face every day in a very real way , a very accessible way . It s moments throughout the day that you do n t have to take a ton of time for , but you recharge , and they help you focus on yourself . We all need that now more than ever . What comes next for Shine ? Marah : The app is a huge brand extension , and it s the next level for Shine in showing that a daily text is powerful . We ve always seen the vision of Shine and what it looks like to change the world , around our openness to talk about the things we struggle with and how we work on ourselves with self-love and self-compassion . Shine text has always been an entry point into that and a really exciting differentiator . This friend-in-your-pocket concept is this first product , and now the app , the second product , together are incredibly strong . Next up you re going to see us evolve and iterate on those products and bring new products to our demographic . Download Shine here .

		"paragraph": "Dual-division champion Daniel Cormier was headed toward the biggest payday of his career with Brock Lesnar on the horizon for early 2019 . So why did Dana White convince him to risk that to fight Derrick Lewis at UFC 230 in New York ? The short answer is the simple one : White was in dire need of a worthy main event for the promotion 's Nov. 3 return to Madison Square Garden , and there were almost no other options . The UFC has tried to put a championship fight at the top of every one of its pay-per-view fight cards . It 's a very rare instance that a UFC pay-per-view headliner is n't a title fight . In trying to make a UFC 230 championship headliner , fight after fight fell apart before it could even get announced . Officials had finally cobbled together a bout between Valentina Shevchenko and Sijara Eubanks for the vacant women 's flyweight title , but reception to that as a possible headliner fell flat . With nowhere else to turn , White turned to the one man he knew he could count on : Daniel Cormier . Cormier was n't willing to take the UFC 230 headlining spot at all costs , however , as he readily admitted that he would n't have accepted a rematch with Stipe Miocic on short notice like he did the bout with Lewis . As he has explained , while Lewis is legitimate contender and a dangerous opponent , his skill set is limited , making Cormier 's fight preparation much easier than it would have been for Miocic , who has many more ways to win in the Octagon than does Lewis . Considering Lewis ' limited range and the UFC likely throwing a massive amount of money his way , Cormier could n't refuse the offer . I did n t think I was going to fight on this card , but the deal I got was so good , Cormier told ESPN recently . There was no way I could say no , honestly . Especially with a guy like Derrick , who is not known for the best cardio . I ve got to start fast and hope I can push harder than him , even with a short camp . White sees it as an exciting match-up for almost all the same reasons that Cormier sees it as a limited risk . Cormier has the skills , the accomplishments , the likelihood of winning ... but Lewis can bring all that crashing down with one well-timed punch . \" Obviously , Derrick Lewis is a tough guy , durable , keeps coming no matter what happens has an unbelievable chin and has the ability to knock anybody out with one punch . He s very exciting and fun to watch , \" White said in an interview with ESPN . \" What can I say about Daniel Cormier ? Daniel Cormier is one of the greatest athletes ever in the history of this sport . He s got two belts right now the heavyweight and light heavyweight titles . I think it s gon na be a fun fight . It s a fun , heavyweight fight . Cormier has never lost at heavyweight and Derrick Lewis is the No. 2 ranked heavyweight in the world . \" TRENDING > Jon Jones Fires Back at Critics Calling Him Cheater to Take Away His Accomplishments White obviously thinks much like Cormier does , that there is minimized risk as far as losing the heavyweight belt is concerned , although he is still charged with promoting it as a competitive match-up . At the end of the day , White is just thankful to have a champion like Cormier on the roster a fighter who is willing to risk it all to save the day . \" Cormier is one of these guys it s like I always talk about ( Conor ) McGregor Cormier is one of these guys , he s willing to put everything on the line . It s what I like so much about Cormier too as a fighter , \" said White . \" I told Cormier , if you re my champion for the rest of my career , I m good . He s a great guy , well spoken , love the way he breaks down fights and does his thing with ( Joe ) Rogan . As far as fighting ? He s lost to one guy his entire career : Jon Jones . That might drive Cormier crazy , not a bad stat , because you know how I feel about Jones . Jon Jones is probably the best to ever do it . \" I love the fight with Cormier vs. Derrick Lewis . It s gon na be fun . You re guaranteed to get your money s worth out of that fight , and those are the type of fights that I love . \"",

		"paragraph": "Warning : This post contains spoilers for Fifty Shades Freed . Laughing during sex is accepted , and even encouraged , in Fifty Shades Freed , the third and final chapter in the Fifty Shades franchise that began with the 2015 adaptation of E.L. James s bestselling trilogy . On the page , the depiction of the S&M - laced romance between the bookish Anastasia Steele and the brooding Christian Grey ( played by Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan onscreen ) was serious to a fault . In contrast , the chief pleasure of the film versions has been their pronounced comic streak , which reaches its apex in Freed . Think back to the couple s hardware store meeting early on in Fifty Shades of Grey , where they trade double-entendre-laden lines about duct tape and rope . Laughs also abound in the extended sequence where Ana carefully reviews the contract that Christian has had drawn up negotiating the exact terms , and toys , to be used in their arrangement . For example , vibrators and dildos are acceptable , but genital clamps ? Strike them from the record . And if you re in the market for a two-word example of the franchise s sense of humor , may we suggest pommel horse ? Now , some might argue that these scenes are a case study in unintentional comedy , of which there is a fair amount in all three movies . But there s also plenty of evidence in their performances , as well as off-screen remarks , that Johnson and Dornan recognize and lean into the absurdity of the series . Let s not forget that it was Dornan who personally okayed the infamous Chronicles of Riddick cameo in Fifty Shades Darker , telling a reporter at the time that he thought it would be kind of funny . And both actors go about their business in Fifty Shades Freed with barely concealed smiles as the now married Mr. and Mrs. Grey fend off the attacks of a stalker with a connection to Christian s past and wrestle with a whole new world : parenthood . At the screening Yahoo Entertainment attended this week , scattered chuckles gave way to waves of unapologetic laughter as the movie unspooled , and we have a sneaking suspicion that s precisely the response everyone involved with the film hoped for … with the likely exception of E.L. James . Here are the five funniest moments in the Fifty Shades trilogy capper . Over the course of two years and three movies , 21-year-old Steele has improbably risen from a hardware store employee to the head of a fiction imprint at a major publishing company . It s a rise that she chalks up , in part , to Christian s influence , but he insists it is due to her own eye for what sells . And apparently what sells is larger fonts ! Walking away from a huddle session , Ana directs one of her employees to increase the font size by two points on a book jacket . It s such a random direction that it feels improvised on the spot by Johnson , who clearly does n t put much stock in her alter ego s business savvy . Apparently , Paul McCartney was Christian s first love before Vin Diesel . While on a rustic getaway with his bride and her buddies , the classically trained pianist serenades them with a spectacularly cheesy rendition of the 1971 Wings anthem Maybe I m Amazed while tickling the ivories . It s a showstopper in that it literally stops the movie dead in its tracks , and Dornan milks his big musical moment for all it s worth . Kickstarter to fund a whole album in which Christian covers everything from Tiny Dancer to Look What You Made Me Do ? While piloting a souped-up luxury vehicle back to Seattle from the rustic mansion that Christian has purchased as their future home , Ana is pursued by a mystery driver in a speeding sedan . Faster than you can say family , she guns the engine and does some serious high-velocity traffic weaving that would impress even Dom Toretto . Even better is her choice of driving music , a faux-funky rock song called The Wolf , which boast howlingly hilarious lyrics like , I wan na jack it , smack it / You know the s *** that turns you on ? As the head of a multinational corporation like Grey House , one would assume that Christian has to keep a fairly busy work schedule . But the movies have never paid much attention to his business activities . ( Personally , we like to imagine that he borrows his business strategy from Unikitty . ) So when Christian s personal architect , Gia , admiringly tells him , I love what you re doing in Africa , he takes it in stride without any elaboration for Ana or us in the audience . Is he actually doing something in Africa ? Who knows ! Not Christian , that s for sure . Here s the most provocative , and funniest , thing about the Fifty Shades movies : while the books and ads tease transgressive eroticism , the films themselves present Ana and Christian as just another ordinary , slightly boring couple for whom even the boldest BDSM play inevitably becomes routine . ( This knowing normalization of S&M feels like a pointed dig at the hype surrounding the larger Fifty Shades phenomenon . ) Johnson and Dornan mostly go through the motions in Freed ‘ s copious sex scenes , with one notable exception : a late-night kitchen encounter where ice cream is their sex toy of choice rather than anything from the tricked-out Red Room . This couple has never seemed happier or more at ease than when they re spreading the dairy product on each others ‘ limbs . Fifty Shades Freed is playing in theaters now .",

		"paragraph": "TOPEKA , Kan. ( AP ) Republican Kris Kobach raised a migrant caravan moving through Mexico as an issue Thursday night in his campaign for Kansas governor , suggesting that lax state immigration policies are helping to lure them north . Kobach , the Kansas secretary of state , is a strong ally of President Donald Trump and has made enacting state policies against illegal immigration a cornerstone of his campaign for governor . He 's had a national profile on the issue for at least a decade and advised Trump 's campaign in 2016 and the White House since . During a debate in the southwest Kansas town of Garden City , Kobach repeated a disputed claim that Kansas provides $ 377 million a year in welfare benefits and other services to immigrants living in the state illegally . \" And policies like that are why we have a caravan marching north to come to the United States , because we give out the goodies as soon as you come across the border , \" Kobach said . Kobach 's statement drew a mix of loud boos and cheers from the crowd , and his closing statement also was interrupted . His comments about immigration came in a wide-ranging debate on familiar campaign themes that included taxes , public school funding and other state spending . Southwest Kansas has seen an influx of immigrants in recent decades , lured by agricultural jobs , particularly in meatpacking . Nearly half of Garden City 's 27,000 residents are Hispanic , according to census figures . Both Democratic nominee Laura Kelly , a veteran state senator from Topeka , and independent candidate Greg Orman , a Kansas City-area businessman , suggested that Kobach 's hardline approach on immigration would hurt the state 's economy . \" So much of our economy , whether you 're talking about here in the southwest or across the state , depends upon quality immigrant labor , \" Kelly said , adding that she 'd push Congress for comprehensive immigration reform to \" let people live in peace . \" Follow John Hanna on Twitter : https://twitter.com/apjdhanna .",

		"paragraph": "There are endless joys to having children : the love , the fun , the cuddling . But Mila Kunis has pointed to one specific benefit of motherhood that has in turn helped her career . During Variety s inaugural Path to Parity women s summit on Wednesday , the actress and mother of two shared that becoming a mom has made her more confident in her own decisions . When asked whether she ever worries about burning bridges when turning down projects because of unfair wages , for instance , she said she used to , but no longer . In response , interviewer and journalist Jenelle Riley said this confidence was a skill people have to learn , to which Kunis responded by crediting motherhood . You know what ? I became a mom , she said . I had better things to concern myself with than some stranger s opinion of whether or not I was a bitch . When I became a mom , so many things that I used to be insecure about and concern myself with no longer mattered , she continued . She also found more power in turning things down . The ability to say ‘ no had a purpose , she said . This is not the first time that Kunis has spoken about rising above other people s opinions . In 2016 , she told Vanity Fair she did n t care what other people thought of her breastfeeding in public . It did n t matter to me what other people thought , she said . That s what I chose to do , but I think it s unfortunate that people are so hard on women who choose to do it and do it in public . She has also spoken of the importance of removing herself from the constant mom competition . It s the competitive energy that is so destructive , she told PopSugar in 2016 . We re all in it together . You only are a mommy in this way for such a brief amount of time anyway that you do n t want to look back and be like , ‘ Why did I care about that stupid nonsense ? Emma Bennett , a licensed psychotherapist who specializes in maternal mental health , is thrilled with Kunis s outlook . The hope and the goal in a lot of my treatment with moms is to shed the outside noise that is pulling them down and to rebuild their confidence , she tells Yahoo Lifestyle . We want to get to a place where moms are feeling OK with being good enough and feel confident in the way that they are taking care of their family . Bennett sees Kunis as embracing her new role . With the birth of any child , there s a birth of a new person : your identity as a mother . I think that she really has embraced her identity since becoming a mom , she says . Things can really shift . Her priorities really changed , and what really matters to her is her children and her family . And the excess nonsense that she was kind of bogged down by seems obsolete . Bennett is particularly impressed by Kunis s ability to say no . She understands her time has so much more weight and value now , because anytime a mom is away from her child … that means a lot more once you become a mom , she says . Everyone has the potential to get to this place , Bennett promises . Kunis definitely has a lot of resources that other moms do n t have , but that being said , I do n t think this level of self-confidence is unattainable .

		"paragraph": "Are you counting the days until you become eligible for Social Security benefits at age 62 ? If so , you 're not alone . Sixty-two has long been one of the most common ages at which to claim Social Security benefits -- even as experts repeatedly advise waiting as long as possible . Waiting to claim Social Security benefits is recommended because your benefits are reduced if you retire early -- before full retirement age ( FRA ) -- and they increase up until age 70 if you wait until after FRA . But just because you may get a larger monthly check by waiting to start your benefits does n't mean delaying is the smart choice for everyone . In fact , there are plenty of reasons really smart people take Social Security at 62 . Here are three of them : Image source : Getty Images . When you 're advised to wait to claim Social Security benefits , the reason is simple : You may be able to get more total benefits by delaying . Since your monthly Social Security income goes up if you wait to claim , eventually that higher income will make up for the years of benefits you did n't collect . As long as you live past the point where you break even , total benefits received will be greater . There 's just one problem : Do you know how long you 're going to live ? If you could predict exactly what would happen in the future , chances are good that you would n't need to worry about how big your Social Security benefits will be . But since humans do n't have that power , it 's impossible to know if you would actually be better off waiting . There 's a solid argument to be made that the smarter move is to take the dollars you 're given today , rather than hoping you 'll live long enough to get more hypothetical dollars a decade or more in the future . The older you get , the more likely it is you 'll start to develop health problems . The question is : Would you rather have money now to travel or indulge your hobbies -- or have extra cash later when you 've developed limitations due to medical issues ? Around 92 % of seniors suffer from one or more chronic conditions , and just over 3/4 of seniors suffer from at least two . There 's little sense in waiting to get a benefit that 's a few hundred dollars bigger if you wo n't get that extra money until it 's too late for you to do much with it . If you 're married , the goal should n't be to maximize your Social Security benefits . It should be to maximize the benefits you receive as a couple . Often , this means it makes sense to sacrifice your higher benefits to help boost your spouse 's Social Security income . Let 's say your spouse earned a lot more money than you . If you both want to retire , you may need some Social Security income to live off of . If you can claim your benefits at 62 , your higher-earning spouse could put off claiming . Not only would you end up with a higher total monthly benefit in the long run , but survivor benefits are also structured so that no matter which spouse passes away , the one left behind gets to keep the higher benefits . Alternatively , sometimes one spouse earns a lot of money and the other does n't work or earns very little . In these circumstances , the higher earner may want to claim benefits at 62 in order to make it possible for the other spouse to claim benefits based on the higher earner 's work record . Spousal benefits can equal up to 50 % of the Social Security check received by the primary beneficiary , but these spousal benefits are n't available until the primary beneficiary has begun claiming . If your spouse is waiting on you to start getting his or her own income from Social Security , claiming ASAP could be a good choice . Are you convinced taking Social Security at 62 can be a smart move ? The important thing to remember is that different people benefit from claiming benefits at different times . You need to understand how Social Security benefits are calculated , determine how your retirement age affects your benefits , and make a choice that makes sense for your family and finances .

		"paragraph": "Warning : This recap for Season 6 , Episode Eight of Downton Abbey contains spoilers . Since the first episode of Downton Abbey , Ladies Mary and Edith have been on a never-ending see-saw . When one s up , the other s down . ( When Sybil was alive , she was off doing her own thing on the jungle gym . ) Last week , Mary put the brakes on her romance with Henry Talbot , while Edith got a marriage proposal from Bertie Pelham . But the see-saw has swung back to Mary s favor , after she blows up Edith s relationship with that secret festering in her icy heart . Then , to add insult to injury , Mary resolves things with Henry and they get hitched in a quickie wedding , while Edith gets dumped by Bertie . Poor , poor Lady Edith . There s one more episode left , the Christmas special ( airing March 6 ) will this Cinderella get her happy ending then ? And will her wicked sister make up for what she did ? Here s what went down this week at the Abbey : Mary and Henry Mary is moping about her breakup , and Tom pushes her to call Henry . He s the one for you , trust me , and give him a chance , he says , but she shrugs him off . People like us ( meaning herself and her titled family , not Tom and certainly not Henry ) have to be careful about who they marry , especially if they re inheriting a fortune . Henry happens to drop by the Abbey after doing some car things in Durham ( which , as Lord Grantham points out , probably are non-existent ) . His visit is highly annoying to Mary , and things just get worse when Henry asks her if money is the only reason she s fighting their relationship . Now , she s even angrier that he s calling her a snob , and storms off . When he leaves without saying goodbye the next morning , and seeing how happy Edith and Bertie look ( more on that below ) , Mary decides to use the sharpest weapon in her arsenal . I admire you , Bertie , she says . Not everyone would accept Edith s past . Oh snap ! Edith is forced to admit to the truth , and Tom yells at Mary for ruining not just her own life , but her sisters . How many lives are you going to wreck just to smother your own misery ? he asks . You re a coward like all bullies , you re a coward . The Dowager Countess is called in to prevent any more wreckage from occurring thanks to Hurricane Mary , and finally Mary confesses what s really holding her back : She can not be a crash widow for a second time . But the Dowager says something very surprising : She believes in rules and traditions , but also , I believe in love . So , Mary stops fighting this feeling . She goes to Matthew s grave to ask for his heavenly blessing , then summons Henry back to Downton . He comes , with a marriage license ( ! ) , and they get hitched the following day . What is this , Las Vegas ? A new couple in a new world , Robert says . Remember when Downton Abbey premiered and Lady Mary looked down her nose at cousin Matthew for being a country lawyer ? Well , this is certainly a new Mary now . Maybe she will even be nicer to Edith . Nah . Edith and Bertie When Bertie talked about his more arty than sporty cousin Lord Hexham , we guessed one of two outcomes : 1 ) His Lordship would come back to England and hook up with Thomas , or 2 ) Bertie would inherit his cousin s title and Edith would be a marchioness . Well , option 2 sort of happened . Lord Hexham dies in Tangiers , and Bertie is his heir ! Golly gumdrops ! a gleeful Robert declares . But Edith is not quite so thrilled she still has n t accepted his proposal or told him about Marigold . Bertie comes to Downton before flying to Tangiers , and presses her for an answer . She seems to be trying to work up the nerve to tell him the truth , but then he talks about being a king of the county and always on parade and his very stern mother . When Edith tells him she loves him , he takes that as a yes , and tells the news to the family the next day at breakfast . That s when Mary goes nuclear on Edith . Bertie asks why Edith did n t tell him about Marigold at the start , and she admits that she thought it would ruin everything . He ca n t marry someone who does n t trust him and who he ca n t trust . Her life was about to be perfectly wonderful , and now it s all slipping away . After they wish each other luck , Bertie leaves . A tearful Edith packs up to leave for London , but not before she and Mary have the row we all knew was coming . Edith calls her a nasty , jealous , scheming bitch . You re a bitch , and not content with ruining your own life , you re determined to ruin mine ! But surprise , surprise , when Mary gets married , Edith shows up in time to attend the wedding . Mary apologizes and Edith explains that she came because they re still sisters . And someday , only they will remember Sybil , their mother and father , their grandmother , Matthew , and Michael Gregson . Our shared memories will mean more than our mutual dislike . Poor Edith . At least she still has little Marigold . Miss Baxter and Mr. MolesleyMr . Molesley begins his stint as a teacher ( part-time as he still works at the Abbey ) , and he s pretty nervous , especially after his first class does n t go well . The students are bored , and he might be expecting too much out of them . But after a pep talk by Miss Baxter , he goes back and reveals that he s been in service for most of his life . The students have parents who are servants , too , and they re awed at the idea that education can give them a leg up on life . Mr. Molesley oh captain , my captain ! Isobel and Lord MertonLord Merton clearly hopes that Isobel will change her mind about marrying him now that the oh-so-friendly Miss Cruikshank is in the picture . But Isobel has tea with the cool little miss , and informs her that she wo n t wed Lord Merton until Larry Grey himself apologizes to her . As the Dowager points out , The ball is in Larry s court only he can play it . Mr. Carson and Mrs. Hughes He s in full Butler of Downton Abbey mode this week , disapproving of Mrs. Patmore s scandal and the Granthams helping her out . But he does n t have to worry that his wife has gone off him . You re my curmudgeon , she says with a kiss on the cheek . Anna and Mr. BatesShe s still pregnant , there is a God . As for the singletons : Poor Thomas moment : Sigh . Poor Thomas episode , more like . Or Poor Thomas s whole life . Look , has he been mean , nasty , scheming , and downright evil in the past ? Yes . He s also a gay man in a world a long way away from accepting him . He s lonely and he s getting pushed out of the one place he s been able to call home . No wonder he slits his wrists . At least Miss Baxter and Andy manage to find him in time . So , maybe he does have some friends after all . Dowager Countess quip of the week : A good butler should not need to be told . Violet , indignant that Spratt did not anticipate her surprise arrival . Downton Abbey airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on Masterpiece on PBS .",

		"paragraph": "SANTA CLARA -- C.J. Beathard set a career high Sunday with 349 passing yards , but there was nothing to celebrate . The 49ers quarterback also was responsible for four of his team 's five turnovers in a 28-18 loss to the previously winless Arizona Cardinals on Sunday at Levi 's Stadium . \" Obviously , after a loss like that , it does n't feel good for anybody , \" Beathard said . \" We 're going to stay positive throughout it all because we 've got to move on to the next week . Obviously , we 'll watch the tape of this one , learn from it and get better from it . \" But you ca n't dwell on it for the next few days . Obviously , today and tonight will hurt and sting , but you 've got to get past it . \" The 49ers ( 1-4 ) were left kicking themselves after thoroughly dominating the statistical columns . The Cardinals scored 21 points off 49ers turnovers , including the game-clinching play on which linebacker Josh Bynes scored on a 23-yard fumble return off Hassan Reddick 's sack and strip of Beathard in the fourth quarter . 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan did n't place all the blame on Beathard , but he did n't absolve him , either . \" He 's a quarterback , and there 's a lot of responsibility on the quarterback to protect the ball , \" Shanahan said . \" There 's 10 other guys out there that can make it easier on him , too . I 'll get through all of them . Usually , fumbles it 's hard to pin on the quarterback . But we 'll look at them hard tomorrow and coach him up the best we can on them . \" Fullback Kyle Juszczyk said the responsibility falls on everyone , including the necessity of the players in the pass patterns to get open quickly to give Beathard a target to whom to throw . Said left tackle Joe Staley : \" He 's back there trying to do what he 's got to do . We 've got to give him more time . \" The 49ers must regroup in time to be ready for the national stage , as they travel next week to face the Green Bay Packers on Monday night . Shanahan said he expects Beathard , who has shown promise in back-to-back losses to the Los Angeles Chargers and the Cardinals after taking over for injured starter Jimmy Garoppolo , to tighten things up in the future . \" The bottom line is you ca n't lose the ball , \" Shanahan said . \" Whether you get hit , whether someone 's not open , sometimes you need to get rid of it , sometimes you need to take sacks . But the worst-case scenario , we plan on ending that series with the ball in our hand , and that 's something he 's got to do a better job of . \"",

But with just two episodes of the A&E TV series Bates Motel remaining , is it possible for Norman ( Freddie Highmore ) to get himself out of a serious jam that seems destined to end in jail time … or worse ? The end of our show is going to be significantly different than the end of the movie Psycho , series co-creator Carlton Cuse tells Yahoo TV . We never saw that as any kind of obligation . And in fact , we thought it would be incredibly disappointing to the audience to give them the ending of the [ movie ] . So really , where we re going now is into the original and uncharted waters of our own ending of our narrative . There s always been these issues of , to what degree are we following Psycho , and we ve never thought of our show that way . We borrowed elements from the mythology of the original movie , but in the same way that Christopher Nolan took elements of the Batman franchise and told his own story , that s what we feel we are doing here , he says . Though one of the main topics throughout the series , Norman s spiraling mental health has been on an even more rapid decline in Season 5 , especially after the death of his mom , Norma ( Vera Farmiga ) , at the end of Season 4 . One of the series most clever storylines in the final season has been to shed light on Norman s condition for the audience as the character himself begins to understand the traumas that have left him with a dissociative identity disorder that leads him to kill people and not remember what he s done . We re in the endgame of Norman s mental illness , Cuse says of Monday s penultimate episode , Visiting Hours , and the April 24 series finale , The Cord . The blueprint of the psychology that we ve worked with for Norman for all these years this was really fun to be able to unfold it for the audience in this last season , Bates co-creator Kerry Ehrin says .

		"paragraph": "Kmart is doing its part to give the plus-size clothing market a fabulous makeover . On Monday , Women s Wear Daily reported that the superstore chain is ditching the plus-size title and replacing it with Fabulously Sized . Better yet , these sizes will be available in all its women s apparel brands , including intimates and swimwear . Curvy girls , rejoice ! When we reached out to our members on social media , they told us we needed to have a better assortment and that we should we call it something different , Kelly Cook , Kmart s chief marketing officer , told WWD . They absolutely love this whole mantra of ‘ Fabulously Sized . … We re proud to provide this apparel , and we re also proud about our price points . She mentioned Kmart s brag-worthy denim , at under $ 10 every day . This change was inspired by the growing movement of women embracing their shapes as further underscored by this past weekend s highly popular body-positivity conference , theCURVYcon ( if you missed it , you can catch the full live stream below ) . As these women increasingly embrace their size , we saw a huge opportunity to grow our apparel business and offer our members more choices , Cook explained . This decision was also heavily influenced by the fact that there s a solid trend on the market around diversity promotion and body positivity . The debate around the plus-size moniker was hashed out at theCURVYcon . During the event s Dear Retailer panel , Jillian Cueff , divisional merchandise manager of special sizes for Macy s , explained that Macy s recently renamed Macy Woman as Plus Sizes to make sure shoppers could properly navigate the store and find the sizes they need . Brian Beitler , EVP and chief marketing officer at Lane Bryant , said that the brand wished we lived in a world where labels were n t required , but that the reality is it also needs a way for customers to sift through its assortment , so it supports the terms plus and curvy for now . Other retailers are not as supportive of any label because it does n t allow all shoppers to have the same experience especially those who want to shop with their friends of different sizes . And now it seems Kmart is making known where it stands . Shoppers will still easily be able to find the sizes they need just instead of looking for the adjective plus , they have to keep their eyes peeled for fabulous .

I just said I wanted to wear these shoes and that makes me somehow great in a very pretend way . \" RELATED : Julia Roberts and Elizabeth Stewart Were Twinning on the Red Carpet But Roberts did n't stop at her team . She explained that when she had just started out in the industry , without the luxury of having a team , she was left her own devices . It was that freedom that grounded her , reminding her that the whole A-list experience of red carpets , movie premieres , and awards shows are anything but ordinary . It was because of that naivety that Roberts wore whatever she wanted , even if it did n't make any sense . \" The great thing about being a nearly 51-year-old person is that 30 years in this business means that I can have incredibly smart people like Richard Curtis talk on my behalf and make me feel good about myself . It truly is about saying thank you , not for me , but for all the people that make me feel like myself in these very bizarre public instances , \" Roberts said . \" If I were to take any credit , I would thank 22-year-old version of me , who wore , ad nauseam , a sort-of-like high-ranking naval jacket that I found at a vintage store with inexplicable black-and-white horizontal striped leggings and thought I was fantastic . For that girl , I thank you . \" RELATED : Julia Roberts Says Rumors About Her and Her Husband \" Hurt \" The speech had one more tidbit : Roberts is a Jeff Goldblum stan just like everyone else she wished him a happy birthday from the podium . If that 's not enough to cement her position as America 's sweetheart forever , nothing else will do it .",

		"paragraph": "Well , it took Apple ( AAPL ) a year to fulfill the promise it made at its developers conference in June 2017 . But here it is , in the new free iOS 11.4 update : Messages in iCloud . Describing this feature is a little trickier than saying , for example , that Apple has added slow-motion video or that the iPhone now obeys your voice commands . But if you choose to turn on this feature , here s what you get : Is there a downside to turning on Messages in iCloud ? The big one is that moving your database into your iCloud account online eats up space there . Apple gives everyone five gigabytes of storage free , but lots of other things eat up that space ( iDisk , backups , iCloud Photo Library , and so on ) . In other words , you re saving tons of space on all your Apple machines , but you re losing space on your iCloud account online . If you want more than five gigabytes of storage , you have to pay Apple monthly for it ( $ 1 a month for 50 gigs , for example ) . And here s something you might expect to be a downside of Messages in iCloud that is n t one : Even if you have no internet connection , you ll still be able to scroll back into the past to see your old messages ! How is that possible ? Because only the photos and other attachments are offloaded to iCloud they leave behind links that you can tap to re-download them . Even then , that stuff is offloaded , automatically and invisibly , only when your phone needs the room ! The text portions of your messages are always stored on your phone ( or other device ) , for quick reference , even after you ve turned on Messages in iCloud . If you decide to move forward , here s how it goes . First , download the iOS 11.4 update . ( On your iPhone or iPad , open Settings - > General - > Software Update , and tap Download and Install . You must be on WiFi to proceed . ) Second , you have to have two-factor authentication turned on , for security . That s an excellent idea anyway here are the steps . Third , on each device , turn on Messages in iCloud : Messages in iCloud is n t available on the Apple Watch , by the way . The Watch will continue to store all of its messages right on the device , and deletions still wo n t be synced with your other gadgets . It takes a few minutes for your devices to offload your entire Messages history to the cloud the phone/tablet must be plugged into power and on WiFi before the process can begin . Once that s done , you ll be treated to a technical but handy upgrade to your texting world . Synchronization across devices , no more waiting to catch up and a lot more storage on your phone .

		"paragraph": "Celebrities use social media as a tool to get closer to fans , but one man crossed the line in a big way with Megan Mullally . The Will & Grace star said she was doing an Instagram Live on Wednesday when a man exposed himself and played with his genitals during her broadcast . She later learned that the user , whose account was based outside the United States , boasted of a video in his highlights section asking if people would like to see a live gang rape , she wrote . So the actress rallied her users and went on a mission to shut down the account of the man , whom she referred to as a sexual predator , on the social media platform . Believe it or not , it took Instagram a little time to address the matter . After her initial post , she made a video telling the Mark Zuckerberg-owned company that it needed to take action against the sexual predator . In it , she pointed out that a lot of kids and teenagers follow me and watch my live videos . why is it fine with you that a man would expose himself and play with his penis ?? When that did n t do the trick , she called in her husband , actor Nick Offerman , for reinforcement , just in case you do n t want to listen to the womenfolk . In that post , in which she again asked for Instagram to address the situation , the #TimesUp supporter wrote , I have a lot of #metoo moments . now i have one more . and you re doing nothing about it . A few hours later , the two-time Emmy winner was back with better news . Instagram had suspended the user s account . We re celebrities , so that may have played a part , she admitted , but urged others to be persistent in making a ruckus if you see #sexualpredation elsewhere . She even urged her followers to tag us if they do . An Instagram spokesperson has not yet responded to Yahoo s request for comment . Mullally s advice to be persistent in making a ruckus if you see #sexual predation seems especially meaningful on a day that many Americans are consumed by the testimony of SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh s accuser Dr. Christine Blasey Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee , and many are sharing #MeToo stories some for the first time , like Busy Philipps and Sarah Hyland .

I take a lot of time and consideration when making decisions and what I m gon na work on … always , Phoenix said . He seems to have a very interesting understanding of this world and what he s trying to say . And so there is something very appealing about that and working with him on this particular project , said of working with the War Dogs and The Hangover Trilogy filmmaker .

Also Read : Joaquin Phoenix 's ' Joker ' Origin Movie Greenlit , Eyes Fall Production Start Phoenix has been thinking about a project like Joker for a hot minute .

And I thought , ‘ You ca n t do the Joker , because , you know , it s just you ca n t do that character , it s just been done .

Other elected officials across the country echoed Biden s sentiments .

		"paragraph": "Warning : This recap for the Stormborn episode of Game of Thrones contains spoilers . Of the many lessons Game of Thrones has taught us over the years , one of the most important is that when you steal a navy and then attempt to have a steamy same-sex makeout session with a rival warlord , sometimes your uncle will show up with a thousand ships that he built over the weekend and murder everybody , including your lover s children . Uncles have ruined a lot of things , but especially these types of scenarios . In other news , the Greyjoy family does not seem like a great family to be a part of ! I ll explain later . Stormborn was the kind of episode that HBO s opening disclaimer indicated contained Graphic Violence , Nudity , Strong Sexual Content , Adult Content , and Adult Language , or as my dad used to call it , Five Stars ! He s dead now . Let s talk about this episode ! It was a dark and stormy night , and a first-time homeowner was beginning to have second thoughts about her soggy condo . You know how even the most lovable dogs smell the absolute worst when they get wet ? Just imagine what a wet DRAGON smells like . Now multiply that by three ! Daenerys will never get that stench out of her platinum tendrils . After a scene in which Daenerys weirdly called Varys onto the floor for being a schemer ( uh , you re welcome , girl ) the waterlogged royal court received a very special visitor ! Melisandre , who is the best , had swung by for a visit and if you did n t already know she was a sorceress , this fact was obvious by how she managed to travel to this castle without getting a drop of rain on her . Also , was her youthfulness spell more powerful than ever ? Welcome back , you sexy crone ! Anyway , the Red Priestess came bearing good news : Daenerys was prophesied to be the chosen one or whatever , plus there was a hot undead hunk up the North who would be a good ally for her . In other words Melisandre had undertaken the matchmaking scheme of the century , and Daenerys was INTO IT . Back at King s Landing , Cersei was attempting to talk her allies into remaining Team Lannister despite the fact that she had committed a flagrant act of war and terrorism upon their peoples and loved ones . Her logic was basically this : Yes I am a bad and untrustworthy person , but the other guys are brown . Yep , the Lannisters were now officially trafficking in white supremacy , so that was very chill . But harnessing the public s darkest and most basic prejudices for political gain could never be an effective power strategy , right ? Right ?! This is a man named Dickon . I think he s Samwell s brother even though he looks different from the hunk who played him last season . Also his name is Dickon . I m currently workshopping a joke , it s something along the lines of Dickon ? Well he s definitely not Unsullied !! I m still working on it , but that was a sneak preview . Anyway , just wanted us all to appreciate this character , and here s to hoping that in future episodes we can all get a little more Dickon . The bannermen who d felt uncertain about aligning with Cersei expressed one primary doubt : Daenerys has DRAGONS . But Cersei s oily , smirking mad scientist bestie was like , Oh , those ? He then revealed to Cersei his secret and dastardly plan to deal with the dragon problem : Shooting them with a giant crossbow . Genius ! How did he ever come up with this idea ? Anyway , the main idea was this : Cersei was still very much in this fight , and not even dragons will be unstabbed ! And then in an all-star matchup to rival that one Marvel movie with all the superheroes in it ( Revengers ? ) , Daenerys and Tyrion hosted a high tea with Yara , Theon , Ellaria , and Lady Olenna ! This was a lot of different countries in one room , plus it was nice they were all female-fronted . What a girl gang ! Most of the people in the room were like , Cool , let s burn King s Landing to the ground but Daenerys was like , Nah , let s be more subtle about it . Ugh , bring a book . Lady Olenna found Daenerys somewhat charming , but even she was like , This world is bulls *** . Ninety-nine percent of her family had just been incinerated by Cersei , and she did n t see this murder-fiesta coming to a close anytime soon , so they may as well exact a little bit of retribution first . But no , Daenerys stood her ground : The Iron Islands fleet would escort the Dornish army to King s Landing for a grain embargo while the Dothraki and Unsullied would , like , TP Casterly Rock . You know , a peaceful invasion . Speaking of peaceful invasions ! Those of us who have been rooting for Game of Thrones ‘ sweetest romance got a huge dose of it this week when Grey Worm revealed his extreme feelings for Missandei and they had no choice but to take their clothes off and get allllll HBO up in there . We re talking skin , skin , skin . But there was one thing we did n t get to see … HBO refused to show us Grey Worm s situation . Oh come on , HBO ! We always have to see ladybits , why not show us a prosthetic Ken doll crotch every now and again ? Sorry to be crude about it , because this was actually a sweet and romantic scene . Needless to say , Grey Worm MADE IT WORK . Congrats , cuties . Yes , that was Ser Jorah reaching his scaly arm out the jail cell slot last week , and this week Sam took it upon himself to try and heal him ! ( Sam felt loyalty toward the Jorahs after working under Ser Jorah s father at Castle Black ) . Anyhow , this involved Sam tracking down the only book in the library about curing greyscale , and then employing a controversial technique that , though it had cured greyscale in the past , also killed the person performing it . This technique ? Simply cutting off the grey scales ! Again , not quite as brilliant as you d think , and it involved so much pus and screaming and , oh god , just imagine the smell . Almost once an episode I express gratitude that we ca n t smell Game of Thrones , and in this scene I got down on my knees and thanked THE LORD for it . So yeah , Ser Jorah s gon na lose a few pounds , but it seems like he ll probably be OK . At a random tavern , Arya ran into an old friend . Hot Pie ! They were buds back when Arya was pretending to be a slave boy , and he seemed happy to see her . At first Arya was very cold toward him , just like , Gim me that bread . But when he mentioned that Jon Snow had retaken Winterfell , she brushed the crumbs from her lap , the tears from her eyes , and hopped on her horse . This murderquest was just going to have to wait ! Later she attempted to make a fire when the temperature suddenly dropped by a million degrees . Were White Walkers in the vicinity ? No , it was the other form of creature that controls temperature … wolves ! And they had a leader … Nymeria ! Remember when Arya s direwolf was banished to the woods back in Season 1 ? Well she s back ! Except , when Arya attempted to get her to join her in Winterfell , the wolf was like , Naw and left . That was n t you , was what Arya muttered to herself , but do you think it was because this was n t actually Nymeria , or just that Nymeria had fully succumbed to the call of the wild ? I truly do n t know and maybe never will . Westeros truly needs to figure out the Group Raven Text situation , because it felt like everyone was sending ravens to each other at the same time . In this case , Daenerys summoned Jon Snow to come hang , and he was like , I m in , but all the other bannermen and child queens were like , Um , hellooo ? Anyway , Jon Snow had spent a long time at Castle Black and clearly needed to lay his eyes on a sexy babe ( aunt ) , so he geared up for a trip south . But guess who will sit in his throne while he s gone ? QUEEN SANSA IS QUEEN . LONG LIVE QUEEN SANSA , QUEEN . ( She ll probably do a good job . ) I liked when Littlefinger took Jon Snow aside to give him a gentle reminder that he s a mega-creep and can not be trusted . He even told Jon Snow that he loved Sansa the same as he d loved their mother . Jon Snow , for his part , immediately strangled Littlefinger , because relax , weirdo ! But though that was a nice and understandable moment , something tells me it was an unwise move on Jon Snow s part . Littlefinger tends to hold grudges , trust me on that . On their carpool back to Dorne , Yara and Ellaria definitely began to make out , and because gay characters are not allowed TO LIVE , their fleet was immediately attacked by this jerk ! Uncles are always making things awkward , and Euron was no exception . And in a tragic turn of events , the Sand Snakes were murdered one by one ! Maybe you did not like those characters , but I did ! I felt bad seeing them get stabbed and choked so much . I loved when the one ran out and whipped Euron in the face a ton . Get him , girl ! Also if I m not mistaken , are n t their daggers and whips poisoned ? If so , Euron s gon na have a tough weekend . Still , rest in peace , ladies ! But yeah , the entire invasion scene was frightening , heartbreaking , and so expensive-looking . All of Yara s ships were destroyed , plus she and Ellaria were taken captive . Euron taunted Theon to come save his sister , and Theon pulled a classic Theon move : He straight-up RAN AWAY . But you know , that s just sort of being consistent at this point . Plus if we know anything about this character , he tends to make up for his cowardice with surprise heroism later . Stay tuned ? Stormborn did a lot to suggest that Cersei will be harder to defeat than we thought . But since WE THE VIEWER know that there is an even bigger threat to the north , it s hard to get overly invested in what s going on with King s Landing , you know ? Like at some point even Cersei s going to have to direct her troops toward a zombie invasion , so right now that s Game of Thrones ‘ biggest source of tension . Will the warring superpowers decimate each other before the White Walkers even arrive , or will they hit pause on this here game of thrones and team up to save humanity ? Perhaps we will learn the answer to this during the next 11 episodes ! What did YOU think of Stormborn ? Game of Thrones airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on HBO .

		"paragraph": "Micron Technology Inc. ( NASDAQ : MU ) did it again . Strong earnings , and a stronger forecast from CEO Sanjay Mehotra , continued to power Micron stock upward , but bears wo n t let it go past the fundamentals so the memory chip maker is still a buy . On June 20 Micron reported net income of $ 3.823 billion , $ 3.10 per share , on revenue of $ 7.8 billion for the quarter . This compares to earnings of $ 1.65 billion , $ 1.40 per share , and revenues of $ 5.56 billion a year ago . Small wonder that the stock has doubled in price from about $ 30 per share to its June 22 opening price of almost $ 60 . But you can still get it at a price to earnings multiple of 7.2 . InvestorPlace - Stock Market News , Stock Advice & Trading Tips Thank the doubters like Timothy Arcuri of UBS , who has again issued a sell rating on the stock , this time with a price target of $ 42 , predicting a big correction in the memory market next year . Bears continue to doubt Micron because every other boost in memory demand has eventually been met by big production increases and a crash . But as I noted in March Micron stock is riding a super cycle in which chip memory is replacing disk in both clients and servers , and it has become cost-efficient for cloud . During the most recent quarter , for instance , I had a hard disk outage on my office PC and went into the memory market . A 1 terabyte disk drive was available for $ 70 , but I went for a 500 GB chip drive instead , for about $ 110 . The increased speed and higher reliability of chips made the higher price worth it . The Cloud Czars are finding the same thing . Mehotra told reporters on TV , radio and online the same story he gave analysts on his conference call , that he sees robust demand for Dynamic Random Access Memory ( DRAM ) chips , in data centers , mobile devices , and for graphical applications . Artificial intelligence , augmented reality , and high-resolution imaging need the speed chip memory provides . This change in the demand equation makes writers who pound the table for the stock look like geniuses . While it is possible that a trade war will cut demand in mobile devices , cloud expansion remains mainly a U.S. market . While Micron does have operations in Taiwan and China , the bulk of its supplies Singapore and the U.S. The super-cycle is not the only thing benefiting Micron stock . It also lucked out with Mehotra , who became available for the CEO chair after Sandisk , which he co-founded and ran for nearly 30 years , was sold to Western Digital Corp. ( NASDAQ : WDC ) . It s like getting LeBron James as a free agent with no other bidders . Mehotra has been able to improve execution at the company and increase its share of the cloud storage market . A tailwind is nothing if you ca n t take advantage of it . Analysts who have noticed Mehotra s performance are now raising their price targets over $ 100 per share . If everyone is in on a stock , it ca n t rise because there are no new buyers available . So long as there are skeptics , willing to make bearish pronouncements , stocks can climb the wall of worry . That s the story of Micron stock . It has disappointed investors in the past , usually as PC sales declined or as supplies from China and elsewhere overwhelmed it . But that s not the case today . Even if bad times were ahead , Mehotra now has a pristine balance sheet , with $ 7 billion of cash on his balance sheet , and less than $ 6 billion of long term debt . It s ready for winter , but cold weather is nowhere in sight . Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist .

		"paragraph": "We ve come to expect that when a TV series rooted in innovation and risk takes its final bow , it will do so with a final , grand flourish . The series finale has become a site for elaborate overreaching ( Mad Men s Coke ad bliss out ) , absurdism ( The Sopranos s fade to black ) , and dreaminess ( take your pick : the Seinfeld cast in jail , the group-hug on The Mary Tyler Moore Show , or the entire run of Newhart being a dream ) . How interesting it was , therefore , to see Girls wrap up on Sunday night with what , in this context , is a big surprise : just a well-written and well acted episode of Girls , without gimmicks or flash . True , the finale jumped into the future , but it was only five months ahead . Hannah ( show creator Lena Dunham ) had had her baby a bouncing , 13-pound boy named Grover and , for once true to her word , has moved out of New York City . She s accompanied by Alison Williams s Marnie , and the trio has settled into a kind of makeshift marriage : two exhausted partners caring for a newborn , with the adults alternately supporting each other emotionally , or squabbling and falling apart . A call for reinforcements was placed , and Hannah s mom , Becky Ann Baker s Loreen , arrived to provide an extra pair of arms and a lifetime of wisdom . The finale written by Dunham , Jenni Konner , and Judd Apatow was crammed with funny moments . Dunham was never credited frequently enough with how good she is at layering jokes very good , old-fashioned sitcom jokes into Girls . I thought of that as I laughed at Hannah s dismissal of Marnie s desire to go into town to see a live jazz trio : The only thing worse than a jazz trio would be a jazz quadrangle . The exchanges between Hannah and Marnie about the pros and cons of breast-feeding had a Ping-Pong energy . I really enjoyed a Girls that had been stripped of its most extreme characters . I did n t need to see Adam Driver bellow as Adam anymore , did n t need to sit through more of the self-indulgent rudeness of Jessa ( Jemima Kirke ) . This season s soup on of Zosia Mamet s Shoshanna was just fine with me a little of her goes too far . The nice thing about the way Dunham and company structured the end of this season is that the previous episode allowed us to say goodbye to excellent characters such as Andrew Rannells Elijah and Alex Karpovsky s Ray , which gave the finale space to be more of a ruminative mood piece but with spark and fizz . From the start of Hannah s pregnancy , when Elijah spoke the truth no one else would utter that Hannah would probably make a terrible mother the question hung in the air : Was she capable of growing up and out of her self-absorption sufficiently to take care of a child ? The show had been built , from the very start of its run , around the comic notion that Hannah was an infantilized 20-something her degree of self-involvement was at once the main source of the character s humor and the frustration of viewers who wanted to give her a kick in the pants . The finale resolved this by contrasting Hannah s struggles as a new mom with her maturity in dealing with a bratty teenager she encounters during a nighttime walk . Without banging us over the head with it , the message was clear : Hannah has now separated herself from adolescent angst she recognized in the teen girl the girl she no longer was . On this final night , Hannah s meltdowns seemed like the perfectly reasonable reactions of all first-time parents . It was wonderful of the show to give Baker such a superb final showcase , dispensing advice without turning into a hectoring scold . For me , the biggest surprise of the finale was its decision to spotlight Marnie the character who , in my experience discussing Girls , has always been the one fans like to dump on . I always found Marnie poignant , underratedly strong and effective as a young woman who wanted to fit into the world rather than rebel against it . As she said this night , pondering why she wants to go to law school , I f *** ing love rules . How interesting , therefore , to see Hannah come to realize that , of all the girls , Marnie was the one capable of being the best friend at this point in their lives . At the same time , Girls was careful to articulate through that conversation Marnie and Loreen have while Hannah is off on her stumpy-legged walk the ways in which Marnie still has to grow and mature without being dependent on Hannah or a man . If you did n t like this finale , you can ignore it and look at last week s episode which brought together all the main stars of the show as the real finale . I liked this episode a lot it was so well-constructed , so well-performed , and so sure of its own instincts . Usually when a series ends , I m ready to close the book on it , leave it and move on to something else . This finale made me want to go back and start watching the first season again , to see Hannah when she was still the bratty young girl she now would advise to grow up .

		"paragraph": "When New Orleans thrashed the Portland Trail Blazers in a first-round sweep , concern surfaced that a Golden State team without Stephen Curry may be vulnerable to Anthony Davis Pelicans . The Warriors quickly put those concerns to rest for a game at least in a dominant 123-101 Game 1 win with Curry still sidelined with an MCL sprain suffered on March 23 . They were so good , in fact , that the conversation shifted to whether it made sense to bring Curry back from Game 2 or let him continue to heal in anticipation of a Western Conference finals showdown with the Houston Rockets . Such is the state of the NBA . Alas , Warriors coach Steve Kerr opted to bring Curry back for Tuesday s Game 2 , and for Golden State , it s a good thing he did . The Warriors needed everything their superstar guard could muster in a 121-116 win over New Orleans to take a 2-0 series lead . Kerr opted to ease Curry back in , bringing him off the bench . Curry provided an instant spark when he entered the game at the 4:20 mark of the first quarter and New Orleans leading , 19-11 . After receiving a roaring ovation from the Oracle Arena crowd , he almost immediately drained a three-pointer from the wing on a designed play off a screen . Three minutes later , Curry had added a layup and a trademark 32-footer to turn the game s momentum in favor of the Warriors . By the time he left the game with 7:50 remaining in the second quarter , Golden State held a 40-38 lead , good for a 10-point swing . A Klay Thompson buzzer-beater at the half combined with a 5-0 Warriors run to start the third quarter gave Golden State a 63-55 lead in what looked like might be the game-changing run . The Pelicans were game , though and punched back playing a physical game focused on getting the ball inside to Davis . And they thrived once again with Curry on the bench , rallying with an 11-2 run to take back a 66-65 lead before Curry returned to the game . Davis owned the paint , tallying 25 points , 15 rebounds , five assists and three blocks as Golden State made life on the perimeter tough for New Orleans . The Pelicans had enough to keep things close until about halfway through the fourth quarter , when Golden State held a 99-98 lead with 7:48 left . But the Warriors found their run , this time led by Kevin Durant who scored six straight as Golden State reeled off 11 unanswered points . And while Curry was n t scoring during that run , he was on the floor for nine of those 11 points . In the end , Curry led Golden State with 28 points , seven rebounds and three steals with 5-10 shooting from distance in 27 minutes . The most telling stat was his plus-26 in the plus/minus column . Whenever he was on the bench , the Pelicans thrived . Whenever he was in the game , he doused their hopes . Durant ( -5 ) and Thompson ( -8 ) combined to shoot 4-for-18 from distance while logging minuses in the plus/minus column . Draymond Green was at his best , posting 20 points , 12 assists and nine rebounds while getting under the skin of the Pelicans , most notably Rajon Rondo . Durant scored 29 , but Green was Golden State s best starter . Unlike Game 1 , the Pelicans came to play on Tuesday , getting 24 points , eight rebounds and eight assists from Jrue Holiday and a remarkable line of 22 points , 12 assists , seven rebounds , five steals and seven turnovers from Rondo . Any talk of the Warriors holding Curry for a presumed matchup with the Rockets seems silly in hindsight . Tuesday looked like a night where they might not have won if not for the heroics of their star point guard .

The 28-year-old-who beat out Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in New York s 14th Congressional District primary last month-secured the 15th district last night as a write-in candidate . The news came as a shock to Ocasio-Cortez , who was n't even pursuing a campaign in the neighboring district . \" Shockingly-and I m told this is not a joke-we have ALSO won a primary in the neighboring 15th Congressional District via write-in campaign on the Reform line ! \" she wrote on Twitter . Since politicians are prohibited from holding two offices simultaneously , Ocasio-Cortez announced that she will continue her Democratic Socialist campaign in the 14th district . \" While I am honored that so many Bronxites are excited about our campaign , I will remain the Dem nominee for NY-14 , \" she explained .

		"paragraph": "CHICAGO ( AP ) From the moment they identified him as the quarterback to lift their struggling franchise , the Chicago Bears envisioned big games from Mitchell Trubisky . As breakthroughs go , this was a huge one . Trubisky threw a career-high six touchdown passes one shy of the NFL record and the NFC North-leading Bears pounded the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 48-10 on Sunday . The Bears ( 3-1 ) won their third straight with Trubisky delivering the sort of performance general manager Ryan Pace envisioned when he traded up a spot to draft the prized quarterback with the No. 2 overall pick last year . He finished one TD pass short of the franchise mark set by Sid Luckman against the New York Giants in 1943 . Luckman is tied with seven others in NFL history to throw seven TD passes in a game . The Bears also racked up 483 yards in this one , nearly matching their record of 488 in that same game , on the way to their highest point total since 51-20 victory over Tennessee in 2012 . \" It 's very humbling because you know the history of the Bears and how many great players have come through this organization , \" Trubisky said . \" For me , you 're just trying to create your own legacy and try to make a path . \" The defense did its part , harassing Ryan Fitzpatrick before Jameis Winston took over to start the second half . And the Bears ( 3-1 ) matched their longest win streak since a 3-0 start in 2013 . Trubisky had never thrown for more than two touchdowns in a game . But he tossed five in the first half alone as Chicago grabbed a 38-3 lead . The only other player with more in a single half since 1991 was Green Bay 's Aaron Rodgers with six in the first two quarters against the Bears in a romp at Lambeau Field in November 2014 . Trubisky had no trouble finding wide-open receivers against a struggling secondary , completing 19 of 26 passes for 354 yards . \" Hopefully , this is a day where we look back down the road here , \" Bears coach Matt Nagy said , \" and say , ' Remember that day where he had that great game ? ' And it helped catapult him into being a great quarterback . \" Khalil Mack had a strip-sack in the first half against Fitzpatrick . That made him the first player with a sack and forced fumble in four straight games since Robert Mathis for Indianapolis in 2005 . He also appeared to tip the ball as Winston released a pass that Danny Trevathan picked off on the first drive of the second half . OVERMATCHED Coming off a tight loss to Pittsburgh on Monday night , the Buccaneers ( 2-2 ) were simply overwhelmed in this one . \" We should fire every person that was on that field today , starting with me . That was horrific , \" coach Dirk Koetter said . Koetter said Winston \" probably \" did enough to regain the starting job , but would n't quite commit to that . Tampa Bay decided to stick with Fitzpatrick as the starting quarterback even though Winston was back from a three-game suspension for violating the NFL 's personal conduct policy . But after becoming the first player in NFL history to top 400 yards passing in three consecutive games , Fitzpatrick was 9 of 18 for 126 yards and got sacked twice . Winston was 16 for 20 with 145 yards , one touchdown and two interceptions . CATCHING ON Chicago 's Tarik Cohen had a career-high 121 yards receiving and a touchdown . Taylor Gabriel had a personal-best 104 yards receiving to go with two TD catches . Trey Burton caught a 39-yard touchdown on the game 's opening drive and finished with 86 yards . Allen Robinson caught a 14-yarder late in the first quarter his first TD since signing with Chicago in the offseason . HICKS EJECTED Bears defensive tackle Akiem Hicks was ejected for pushing an official late in the first half . The incident occurred after Eddie Jackson intercepted a pass by Fitzpatrick . Hicks was involved in a scuffle away from the play with a Buccaneers player . Down judge Mike Carr had separated them when Hicks charged back and pushed the official , referee Jerome Boger told a pool reporter . \" It was just a deliberate act , when he knew the official was there in-between , \" Boger said . Hicks remained on the sideline for a few plays before leaving the field and threw his shoulder pads and jersey into the stands . NATIONAL ANTHEM There were no obvious protests by either team . INJURIES Buccaneers : TE O.J. Howard left in the first half because of a knee injury . ... CB Carlton Davis III aggravated a groin injury . Bears : LB Sam Acho left in the first half with a pectoral injury . UP NEXT Buccaneers : Have bye week . At Atlanta on Oct. 14 . Bears : Have bye week . At Miami on Oct. 14 .

		"paragraph": "No. 7 Michigan was tested in a big way at home against Air Force this week , which says as much about the Wolverines offense as it does about the Falcons . Michigan s lead was just 19-13 entering the fourth quarter until the Wolverines sealed the game with a late touchdown in an eventual 29-13 victory . Still , Michigan s players walked off the field with nothing but respect for their opponent . Just look at what Wolverines defensive end Chase Winovich had to say after the win : This is a reminder of just how impressive the kids at the U.S. service academies are , a fantastic way to compliment your opponents and one of the best quotes we ll get this season . With that in mind , let s recognize a few of the Falcons standouts from their trip to The Big House . Junior quarterback Arion Worthman completed just one of seven passes on Saturday , but that single completion was a 64-yard touchdown . Other things completed in Worthman s college career include the Air Force s survival training and soaring program . Senior running back Tim McVey rushed for 62 yards on 11 carries . He s also finished the power flight program at the Air Force Academy . Falcons senior kicker Luke Strebel , who made two of three field goals against Michigan , is majoring in systems engineering and happens to be the second in his family to attend the United States Air Force Academy . Will each one of these players go on to fight terrorists ? Not necessarily , though that does n t make their devotion to their country and their service academy any less impressive . And if the way the Falcons took on Michigan is any indication , it s hard to argue with Winovich s assessment .

		"paragraph": "Walmart began making headlines Thursday morning when it was reported that the nation s largest private-sector employer would be testing a new relaxed employee dress code . According to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg , the retail chain announced that some stores would be testing a revised uniform that allows for blue jeans , jeggings , chinos , skorts , and shirts of any solid color . Although it sounds like a nice change from the infamous khakis and blue shirts with collars , people are bothered that the retail corporation seems to be doing the least it could do to save itself from an increasingly competitive labor market . This is n t the first time that the discount department store is making the news for implementing a new dress code . Just four years ago , Walmart put into place the requirement of wearing either a white or blue collared shirt with khaki pants or black jeans , in addition to a Walmart vest . The reason behind the change was to make it easier for customers to find employees in the superstores . But now , the company is more concerned with pleasing the workers themselves . As the nation s unemployment rate continues to drop , Walmart is not the only store experiencing pressure to provide employees with reasons to stick around . However , with the various incentives that could be put in place to keep Walmart employees in their stores , dress code is not the most important . This move comes after Walmart raised its starting hourly wages to $ 11 earlier in 2018 , in addition to providing bonuses to employees of up to $ 1,000 . The changes came in response to President Donald Trump s tax cuts , which created a shift in the big-box retail market overall . Walmart also increased paid parental leave at the time however , some believe that larger management issues still do n t make these minimal benefits worth it . In terms of Walmart s dress code , the chain is known for having employees pay for the required uniform items themselves , which poses an additional monetary issue when the dress code is revised . However , Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg told Bloomberg that the changes are not yet permanent . We are always testing new ideas and concepts in a small number of our stores , Lundberg said . Some of these tests are expanded while others are retired . We wo n t know next steps on this test until we ve had a chance to learn what works and what could work better . In the meantime , employees remain divided over a number of issues but some are expressing their excitement over being able to have a broader range of outfit options for work .

		"paragraph": "It 's been more than three years since GM re-entered the midsize pickup truck market with two cars , the GMC Canyon and its twin , the Chevy Colorado . To keep things fresh , GM later added a diesel model of the Canyon for the more heavy-duty users out there . After a week with the most high-end model -- it 's called the Canyon Denali -- with a diesel engine , I 'm sold on the GMC Canyon . It 's comfortable , confident and capable , but it 's hard to make a case for why someone might want the diesel version . Here 's what you need to know about it . When they arrived , the Canyon and Colorado ushered in a new era of refinement and civility in the class . The Toyota Tacoma instantly felt outdated . Even when Toyota updated it shortly thereafter , the Tacoma was still rougher around the edges than the GM entries . Now , a new Honda Ridgeline truck probably wears the comfort crown , but its unibody construction and car-like demeanor make it tough for truck-buyers to take seriously . The Canyon is the happy middle . It 's a real truck with an actual truck frame , but it 's also adorned with leather and high-quality interior trimmings when ordered in its top-of-the-line Denali trim . Priced at $ 48,290 , it 's also adorned with leather and high-quality interior trimmings including cooled seats , CarPlay and a Bose stereo . GM 's infotainment system is also much easier to use than others . More importantly , it feels luxurious on the road . We 'll talk engine noise below , but the well-insulated cabin keeps any other harshness out . It 's also comfortable , with a well-damped ride that does n't exhibit the traditional bounciness of a pickup truck . Handling , too , is n't as ponderous as the trucks of yore . Do n't get any wrong impressions : this is not a sporty vehicle , but its slightly smaller size and confident handling help make parking far less annoying than other trucks Should you need to test that toughness , the Canyon is up to or above the standards of the class . Ignore the lowly 189-horsepower rating on this motor because , with diesel cars , you care about torque . The Canyon delivers a massive 369 pound-feet of torque , good for towing up to 7,600 pounds in four-wheel-drive spec . Finally , the diesel engine is rated for 30 miles per gallon on the highway . That 's class-leading , but you 're also likely to pay more for diesel at the pump . You 're also going to pay more at the dealership , as GMC charges $ 3,730 for the Duramax diesel option . Even if gas prices get high and the math works out in the diesel 's favor , you 're probably not seeing a return there until far down the road . In the meantime , you 're dealing with a decidedly less refined power-train . When GMC dropped off the Canyon , I did n't actually know I was getting a diesel . But in the 15-second drive from the entrance of my garage to the parking space , it was evident that I was n't burning gasoline . This car is louder , vibrates more harshly and feels more lethargic than the gas V6 of the standard vehicle . I would n't get the diesel . I do n't have many other complaints about the Canyon . The fake wood trim adoring the gear lever is tacky and the $ 48,290 is expensive for faux materials . But subtract the diesel premium , and you 're under the $ 45,000 mark . For a top-of-the-line midsize pickup that 's this refined , it 's really quite fair . A Canyon Denali Crew Cab 4x4 with the shorter bed option starts at $ 44,295 . $ 495 gets you this lovely red or a premium silver paint job , which classes up the truck significantly . The Denali comes with everything else you need as standard . The total price comes to $ 44,790 with a premium color paint . If you want a near-luxury body-on-frame pickup but do n't want to step up to the full-size market , GMC is the only game in town . Lucky for us , it happens to be quite good at its job . Besides the sometimes-talkative engine , the Canyon 's cabin is remarkably quiet . There is n't the trademark bounciness that typically soils the ride of a pickup . Plus , despite this being a \" midsize \" truck there 's a massive amount of room in the cabin . For people looking for a premium truck at a good price , the Canyon is unbeatable . But more than that , if you 're considering a premium car and a work pickup , you wo n't be sacrificing much if you get one vehicle that can handle both duties . Rating : Exterior : 5 Interior : 4 Driving Experience : 3.5 Value : 4.5 Overall : 4 Price as configured : $ 48,290",

		"paragraph": "On Wednesday , the Rick Adelman-led Minnesota Timberwolves fell to the Chicago Bulls by a 102-87 score . The loss dropped the Wolves to .500 , a record that in most years prior to the post-Jordan era would earn a Western Conference team a playoff berth , and a mark that would easily slide Minnesota into the eighth spot in this year s Eastern playoffs bracket . Minnesota will not be making the playoffs this year , though . Wolves forward Kevin Love hyper-extended his right ( shooting ) elbow during the game and suffered through a 7-20 night , Bulls center Joakim Noah abused both Love and impressive Minnnesota rookie big man Gorgui Dieng for a 15-point , 13-rebound , 10-assist triple-double , as the Timberwolves ( who were officially eliminated from the playoffs earlier in April ) continued to play out the string . Which is a shame , on so many levels . For one , it will deny NBA fans the chance to watch the brilliant Kevin Love play into the postseason . It will leave one of the NBA s most fluid and entertaining offenses , even if that offense s shots are n t falling , from playing playoff ball , and it will call into question the mettle of a roster with a point differential that typically results in a 50-win season , instead finishing a year with a mediocre win/loss record . It could also sign off on the idea that coach Rick Adelman , who has been rumored to want to walk away from Minnesota following this season , could be coaching his last week in the NBA . Adelman has n t signed off on any such notion , he s not the type that would want the go-to rocking chair ceremony to hit during a meaningless regular season game in mid-April , but he s also nearing 68 years of age , and he has the health of his wife to consider . Rick has missed one game this season and had to leave the team for 11 games last season to help attend to his wife Mary Kay , who has struggled with seizures , and it would make complete and total sense for Adelman to decline to opt in to the final year of his four-year contract . The Timberwolves and Adelman have until the end of April to determine if either side wants to continue with the partnership , a duel coach/team contract option that has the hallmarks of former general manager David Kahn all over it because every coach of any age , no matter the context or even sport , wants to walk away from the gig just a fortnight after a long , grueling season . The firing of Kahn in 2013 would seem to have brightened things from Adelman s prospective , but the ascension of the winningest coach in Wolves history new ish Minnesota president Flip Saunders has left some wondering whether Saunders will want to work as a band-aid coach in 2014-15 in order to make one last effort to keep potential 2015 free agent Kevin Love in the fold . Adelman s time with the Timberwolves has yet to produce a playoff appearance , and in the postseason s absence we ve seen a seemingly incurable strain of strangeness surrounding this team . Kahn s era produced heaps of blown high lottery picks ( Love s 2008 NBA draft selection was by former coach/GM Kevin McHale ) , and though Saunders contract extension of solid offensive center Nikola Pekovic ( also a McHale pick ) and signing of Kevin Martin last summer looked good on paper , injuries and inconsistency have rendered the Wolves lottery participants yet again . Which means Rick Adelman could go out without having won a championship as a coach , while spending his last three NBA seasons minding the sideline store of one of the oddest NBA clubs in recent memory . Absolutely no way to go out , though this may have to be the case . It could be yet another hallmark of one of the more sadder aspects of Adelman s coaching career , because while the Loyola Maramount product and seven-year NBA playing veteran has had his moments in the sun , those years have also included terrible timing and unfortunate luck in spite of the talent of the players and coaching staffs involved . Adelman became Portland Trail Blazers head coach in 1989 , and took one of the great teams to have never won a championship to the Finals in 1990 and 1992 , only to lose to Isiah Thomas Detroit Pistons ( though Joe Dumars was the star of that series ) and Michael Jordan s Bulls in those respective years . Adelman watched as the Blazers dealt Clyde Drexler to the Houston Rockets for serviceable but non-All-Star forward Otis Thorpe in 1995 , only to witness Drexler help those Rockets win their second consecutive title a few months later . Adelman joined the Golden State Warriors during the 1995 playoffs to act as their head coach , hoping to settle a team that had been rocked by the rift between former coach/GM Don Nelson and Chris Webber in the years prior . The new coach watched as GM Garry St. Jean drafted Joe Smith tops in the 1995 draft , dealt Tom Gugliotta ( the forward acquired for Webber who would later go on to be an All-Star ) for Donyell Marshall , traded Tim Hardaway for the aging Kevin Willis , and drafted Todd Fuller in the 1996 NBA draft . The coach was fired over the 1997 offseason and in a rare stroke of good timing , it took place just before Latrell Sprewell hit his breaking point , as Sprewell attacked Adelman s successor P.J. Carlesimo during an early season practice in 1997-98 . Hired by Princeton devotee Geoff Petrie to guide the Sacramento Kings in 1998 , Adelman immediately set to work with a re-jigged Kings club that had added Webber , Vlade Divac , Jon Barry , Peja Stojakovic and Jason Williams over a tumultuous 1998-99 offseason . The team nearly toppled the top-ranked Utah Jazz in the first round of that year s playoffs , almost becoming the second eighth seed in NBA history to beat a No. 1 seed at the time , and struck the same fear into the Los Angeles Lakers during the first round in 2000 . By 2001 and 2002 , though , the Kings had grown into championship contenders under Adelman . And though Shaquille O Neal and Kobe Bryant were dominant , Allen Iverson was inspiring , and San Antonio s Tim Duncan was rock steady over this spell , the up-tempo Kings were the only team anyone wanted to watch during one of the low points in the NBA s history . Part of this was on Rick Adelman going against the grain , and pairing a willingness to let his team run with his own Princeton-movement instincts . With former Princeton Tigers coach Pete Carril watching from the sidelines as Kings assistant coach , the Kings were barely toppled ( and some would say robbed ) in a 2002 Western Conference final that was far more competitive and telling than that year s dreary NBA Finals between the Lakers and outclassed New Jersey Nets . Chris Webber injured his knee in the 2003 playoffs , though , necessitating a microfracture surgery that would just about destroy his career . The addition of Brad Miller turned the Kings into a championship contender in 2004 , but the team lost to a top-seeded Minnesota squad in the last year that the Timberwolves would make the playoffs to date . The Kings traded Webber midway through 2004-05 for a rotating cast of lesser players with even worse contracts , and Adelman and Sacramento parted ways in 2006 . Houston general manager Daryl Morey latched on to Adelman in 2007 , hoping his fluid offense could help turn a team led by Yao Ming and Tracy McGrady into a champion , but both players would succumb to injury soon enough , even if Adelman s offense and deft touch with player personnel helped the Rockets win 22 consecutive games in 2008 . Three more solid seasons followed , as Adelman circled the wagons while Morey acquired the assets that would spark up a Houston turnaround long after Adelman left the team . The partnership ended as Adelman moved to Minnesota to help clean up the disastrous turn by former Wolves coach Kurt Rambis , while making sense of the flotsam and jetsam that Kahn had provided for him . Obviously , it has n t turned out . Rick Adelman s time in Minnesota has been undercut by the after effects of four badly failed drafts in a row by Kahn , Ricky Rubio s inability to develop a shooting or finishing touch ( something that was in place years before Kahn drafted him ) , the impossibly strange late game failures for the squad in 2013-14 , and crucial injuries throughout . Rick Adelman may have a week left , and he probably does n t want a party to be thrown for him in his honor as he walks away . Defy the man s wishes , NBA fans . - - - - - - - Kelly Dwyer is an editor for Ball Do n't Lie on Yahoo Sports . Have a tip ? Email him at KDonhoops@yahoo.com or follow him on Twitter !

		"paragraph": "By Crispian Balmer and Aislinn Laing VATICAN CITY and SANTIAGO ( Reuters ) - In an unprecedented move , all of Chile 's bishops offered to resign on Friday after attending a crisis meeting this week with Pope Francis about the cover-up of sexual abuse in the South American nation . Several victims invited by the pope to Rome earlier this month said they wanted all 34 bishops sacked and replaced by more moral candidates , and for the Vatican to extend punishment to others implicated in the scandal . The offer of mass resignations on Friday by the bishops summoned to Rome marks the first time that all the senior Roman Catholic prelates of a country have taken such a step , a Vatican official said . A Vatican official declined to speculate on the pope 's response . \" We have put our positions in the hands of the Holy Father and will leave it to him to decide freely for each of us , \" the bishops said in a joint statement read out by a spokesman for them , Bishop Fernando Ramos . The announcement followed four days of discussions in the Vatican , where the pope accused the bishops of \" grave negligence \" in investigating allegations that children had been abused and saying evidence of sex crimes had been destroyed . Apologizing to the victims , the pope and to Chile for the failings of Chile 's churchmen , Ramos said the bishops would all stay in their roles until Francis had decided what to do . The scandal that has swirled around the Chilean church for more than 20 years erupted four months ago when the pope visited Chile , prompting questions about his response to the serious claims of abuse . Chilean victims of abuse welcomed news the bishops were ready to stand down but insisted the Vatican should take further , punitive action against the bishops . Juan Carlos Cruz , one of three Chilean victims invited by the pope to Rome earlier this month , said the \" corrupt \" bishops should be replaced by those in the church who had helped abuse victims . \" There are very good people within the Chilean Church who could take over the reigns and repair the damage done by these corrupt bishops , \" Cruz said in an interview . Eneas Espinoza , a Chilean man who claims to have been abused while at a school run by the Marist brothers , called on the pope to pursue a canonical prosecution that could see them stripped of all titles and benefits . \" We want concrete , real action , \" he said in an interview . \" I do n't want my abuser to end up living in a plush retirement home . \" The scandal revolves around Father Fernando Karadima , who was found guilty in a 2011 Vatican investigation of abusing boys in Santiago in the 1970s and 1980s . Now 87 and living in a nursing home in Chile , he has always denied any wrongdoing . Victims accused Bishop Juan Barros of having witnessed the abuse but doing nothing to stop it . Barros , who was one of those who offered to stand down , has denied the allegations . Friday 's resignations came just four months after the pope had visited Chile in a trip that raised questions over his response to abuse scandals that have rocked the church over the past 17 years and his willingness to deal with the crisis . During the visit , Pope Francis staunchly defended Barros , denouncing accusations against him as \" slander . \" But days after returning to Rome , the pope , citing new information , sent sexual abuse investigator Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta to Chile to speak to victims , witnesses and other church members . Some of his findings were included in a damning 10-page document that was presented to the bishops this week , according to Chile 's T13 television , which obtained a leaked copy . A source in the Vatican confirmed the report was genuine . In it , the pope said he felt \" shame \" over the pressure put on people not to carry out full investigations into what had happened , saying some churchmen had been afraid to face their responsibilities and confront \" the ramifications of evil . \" \" We are all involved , myself in first place , and no one can be exempted by looking to shift the problem onto the backs of others , \" the pope wrote .

		"paragraph": "I write about Meghan Markle so often that sometimes I forget I am not the Duchess of Sussex myself . I know what went into her wedding-day messy bun , and I 've meticulously searched the internet to find ( then run out and buy ) every single beauty product the royal knows and loves . Heck , I even know what her nuptial dressing room smelled like . So when I heard that one of Markle 's favorite cleansers just got reformulated , I had to pull a Beyonc and upgrade my own face wash routine , too . Back in 2014 , a pre-Harry Markle told Allure that she \" really loved \" the Tatcha Rice Enzyme Powder ( $ 65 ) . \" It just sort of foams on your face and gives you a really subtle exfoliation , \" she said . Four years later , the J-beauty brand has revamped the item to be suitable for all skin types . There 's a classic option for normal to combination skin deep , which unclogs oily pores gentle , to quell dry flakes and calming , to soothe irritated complexions . Image Source : Getty / Samir Hussein Whichever works best for you , Tatcha just made all iterations a lot more gentle by switching the base to a pH-neutral amino acid . This means that unlike harsh , traditional soaps , the formula that 's responsible for Markle 's sparkle wo n't strip your skin of its natural nutrients . I managed to get my hands on an early sample of the new cleanser the day after recovering from a gnarly breakout , so I got to test the validity of the brand 's gentle claims . After putting a pea-sized amount of this powder on my hands , I splashed just a bit of warm water onto it and rubbed it on my face for about eight seconds before washing off . Normally , I 'm not crazy about scrubs , because I find them to be really irritating , especially over acne . But like Markle said , it lathered into a really soft , plush foam that felt both moisturizing and pore-clearing . The morning after I tried it , I tiptoed to my medicine cabinet mirror afraid that I 'd awake to finding myself a splotchy , red mess , because so many severe products can make me that way . And all I can say is - Markle , I never should have doubted you . I may not have that look-of-love twinkle that comes with marrying a foreign prince , but I also do n't have any surprise breakouts , either . I 'll take what I can get .

		"paragraph": "Are wedding bells ringing for Meg Ryan and John Mellencamp ? There s buzz that the under-the-radar couple is planning to wed in South Carolina this summer . While completely unconfirmed , it would n t be all that surprising , given the pair s penchant for privacy . Unfortunately , the best wedding rumor that Tom Hanks will walk his Sleepless in Seattle and You ve Got Mail co-star down the aisle was just debunked . ( Tears ! ) But that has n t slowed speculation that the couple is secretly engaged . Ryan , 56 , and the 66-year-old rocker have been on-again , off-again since late 2010 . They got together shortly after Mellencamp s split from his ex-wife , Elaine Irwin , to whom he was married for 18 years . Neither Ryan nor Mellencamp spoke much about their romance the first time around , and they ended the relationship as quietly as it began . The couple split in the summer of 2014 due to the long distance between their homes . The actress lives in New York City , while Mellencamp has homes in Indiana and South Carolina , and he said moving would n t be an option . I m too sensitive to live [ in New York ] , he told Rolling Stone in 2013 . I ca n t see poor people . I ca n t see the suffering . I ca n t see the trash on the streets . There was also the whole issue of being followed by paparazzi . I do n t give a f *** about me , but I do n t like it for [ Ryan ] , he exclaimed . I m not leaving Indiana . I m going to die here . Meg is an angel . She was just an angel sent to me at the right time , Mellencamp gushed on Sirius XM s The Howard Stern Show in September 2014 . We tried to have a relationship for three years long distance . Still , the singer hinted at the time that the two could reconcile , saying , We ll see what happens . Mellencamp moved on with Christie Brinkley , dating the model for about a year before splitting in 2016 . As for Ryan , she kept a relatively low profile in the romance department . I m on a little break [ from love ] , she told Closer in 2015 . I m [ in love ] with my life right now in a way that I adore , with my kids and my world . She continued , I love my age . I love my life right now . I love what I know about . I love the person I ve become , the one I ve evolved into . In my life I ve been scrappy as hell , but I feel easy with things now . I think that comes with age . While it initially seemed like Ryan and Mellencamp s split was amicable , the singer hinted at some bad blood . Upon his return to the The Howard Stern Show in 2017 , he exclaimed that women hate me . You know , I love Meg Ryan , he said . She hates me to death . When asked why , Mellencamp responded : I think it s because I m a child . I throw fits , I gripe , I complain . I m moody . Every bad thing that a fella can be , that s me . Stern suggested that his friend call up Ryan and apologize . I ve done that , Mellencamp said . She just does n t want anything to do with me , and I ca n t blame her . Perhaps his public mea culpa was just what was needed to clear the air . Months later , Mellencamp and Ryan were photographed together again . They have a bond , a source told People of the pair . Just like that , they were officially back together . It seems as if their families approve , too . The actress has been seen sporting a ring on that finger at times since their reconciliation . Ryan has two kids Jack , 26 , from her 10-year marriage to Dennis Quaid , and adopted daughter Daisy , 14 . John has five children Michelle , 47 Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Teddi , 36 Justice , 33 Speck , 23 and Hud , 24 from his three marriages . If Mellencamp and Ryan are engaged , it will be his fourth trip down the aisle . He was married to Priscilla Mellencamp ( 1970-1981 ) , Victoria Granucci ( 1981-1989 ) , and Elaine Irwin ( 1992-2011 ) . Read more from Yahoo Entertainment : ",

		"paragraph": "It was early 2016 , and Eric Pearson was practically living at the Frank G. Wells Building on the Disney Studios lot in Burbank , Calif. , camped out in his office until 2 or 3 o clock in the morning . The screenwriter , who d risen through the ranks of the Marvel Writer s Program , was nearing completion on an early draft of a script for Thor : Ragnarok , the threequel currently thundering all over the worldwide box office . ( The film just passed the $ 500 million mark . ) Pearson was nearing the climactic showdown between Thor ( Chris Hemsworth ) and the indomitable Asgardian goddess of death , Hela ( Cate Blanchett ) , and the stakes did n t seem high enough . That s when the idea struck : What if Hela was actually Thor s blood relative ? Specifically , his sister . In the comics , Hela is allegedly the daughter of Loki , Thor s shape-shifting , trick-loving brother played by Tom Hiddleston in the movies , and the sorceress Angrboda . But that had never been the plan for the screen treatment . We had decided that she s like this ghost of Asgard s past that s come back , Pearson explained to Yahoo Entertainment . She represents the kind of violent way that they won their kingdom that Odin s been trying to cover up . On one of those late nights , Pearson encountered Brad Winderbaum , VP of production and development at Marvel Studios , who himself had climbed company ranks , first as a unit producer on Iron Man 3 , then as a co-producer on Ant-Man , and now as an executive producer on Ragnarok . I was like , ‘ We re getting to this moment , and it just does n t have the impact , ' Pearson recalled telling Winderbaum . I m like , ‘ With all this stuff , she should be Thor s sister . And that should be the thing that [ represents ] what it is to rule Asgard , his family , what he s been told , what he has n t been told . ' Winderbaum offered Pearson , who had previously contributed rewrites on Ant-Man and worked on various Marvel One Shot shorts but was getting his first go at a full feature , some sage advice . Brad told me , ‘ Do n t tell anyone . Just write it into the script . If we pitch it , it s so much more likely to get shot down . Just write it into the movie . ' Pearson initially gave the reveal to the scarred and indifferent Asgardian warrior Valkyrie ( Tessa Thompson ) , who told Thor in Hulk s suite , ‘ She s your sister . The script , mythology-busting twist included , then made its way to the desk of Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige . Pearson was terrified . When they did that first read , I was like , ‘ Oh , man , if they do n t like it , we re screwed . ' Obviously , they liked it . Brad showed me Kevin s note , and [ the reveal ] was circled with ‘ WHOA ! [ spelled out next to it ] , Pearson recounted proudly . Eventually the revelation would be delivered via Odin ( Anthony Hopkins ) , the cinematic father of Thor and Hela , because , as Pearson explained , they wanted to make the most out of the Asgardian king s limited screen time and make Valkyrie s role in the film less Thor-reliant ( more on that below ) . In the end , it was well worth the gamble . I was just so happy that it played out , because we were taking a risk , said Pearson . Some other notable nuggets from the writing ( and rewriting ) process Pearson provided : There was almost a romance subplot with Thor and Valkyrie When Pearson took over scripting duties from original writers Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost , Thor and Valkyrie had cozied up . But we did n t want to start from that place , Pearson explained . It was like , Let s give Valkyrie her own story that connects with Thor … and if it makes sense for them to get together , then great . You ve got two really good-looking people who can fight and who d probably be [ good together ] if the story went there , but it just did n t . It became more about the mutual respect , and also dealing with her PTSD . She s someone who s drowning her sorrows in the bottle , and I just thought that was such a cool thing that you do n t often see in these movies : somebody dealing with extreme guilt and shame in a colorful , Taika Waititi [ - directed ] hilarious background . As for Valkyrie s sexuality ( Thompson has hinted on Twitter that the character is bisexual and told Rolling Stone there was a scene cut from the film featuring her female partner ) , Pearson said that Valkyrie s sexuality was neither confirmed nor denied in the script , adding , but I defer to Tessa . She s the actor , a great actress , and in that person s skin . There was originally more Hela Blanchett fans might be bummed to learn there were two additional scenes with her in Pearson s original draft that they had to lose for time and production . I always want the villain to be really … not-Disney . I want to give them moments where they re really massacring or crushing people , he explained . And she has that great entrance where she takes everybody out . [ Originally it was extended , ] and they were like , ‘ This is a bit repetitive , and we do n t have the days to shoot it . There was [ also ] a scene where she thought they were hiding the sword in the armory , this big fortress . She goes up , and the destroyer armor comes out to take her out , and she just rips that thing apart too , just to call back the destroyer armor . And it just felt like an extra beat that we did n t need . We needed to get Thor pushing back to Asgard as fast as possible . Pearson did , however , lobby for one of her most rousing moments . When they told me Cate Blanchett [ was cast ] , I was like , ‘ Guys , do n t you want to see her give a speech ? Do n t you want the best in the world to come in as cool as she is and just tell everyone what she s going to do ? ' he said . And they re like , ‘ Yeah , you re probably right . And so I got to write a speech for her . And then Taika of course comes in with the brilliant way to take the piss out of it at the end . There was a gross food moment that got trashed For a view into the frustrations of major blockbuster screenwriting , look no further than the tale of the noodle worm . As part of a scene that we f *** ing rewrote , like , 10 million times , very roughly estimated by Pearson , it was an emotional check-in moment with Bruce Banner ( Mark Ruffalo ) and Thor before the finale , with Banner eating alien food and trying to be serious . It [ looks like ] spaghetti , but then he realizes the thing he s eating is alive on the end . Ultimately , the Noodle Worm Scene , as they called it , was squashed . I spent so much time on it , and it just never made it in . We thought it was this pivotal character moment , and it never had a place . It crushed the momentum .

		"paragraph": "Alec Baldwin will reprise his impression of President Donald Trump in the 44th season of Saturday Night Live , the actor revealed during the Origins podcast with author James Andrew Miller , a longtime SNL chronicler . Trump is insane . I think most people know , the guy he is insane . We have a man who is president who is insane Baldwin said during the program . You ca n t go far enough with this idiot . You ca n t go far enough . You ca n t go far enough . The 44th season of Saturday Night Live is slated to kick off on Saturday , September 29 . Lorne Michaels , the executive producer of Saturday Night Live , told Miller that he was glad to have Baldwin return to the role . I think there is probably no other actor who is looking to take that and follow Alec . And I think , for a new cast member to come in and try that would be a really tough thing to do , Michaels said . And yet , Michaels noted , there does not seem to be any guarantee that Baldwin will continue the role from one season to the next . I think with Alec , I ve known him and worked with him for so long , that needless to say I trust him . And the audience connects to him in that role . Sometimes I feel like we are still in campaign mode . But , I thought we see each other a fair amount , so we do n t much talk about it in the offseason . And then , I think he was at the US Open last week , and somebody asked him if he was doing Trump . And he said , ‘ yea . And his agent Matt DelPiano texted me and said , ‘ I think he s doing Trump . And I went oh , ok . But , he is somebody you know you can always count on . Baldwin s portrayal of the 45th President has lent the NBC mainstay a new relevance and made it part of the ongoing political conversation in late night . But other members of the show also view the impression as something ephemeral part of the moment , but never guaranteed to be part of the show forever . No Trump , less Trump I do n t know . Like when it s right , it s right . The funny thing is there is a Trump exhaustion in the country and I feel like from the show even , you know . But it s hard to leave him out of the conversation , said Michael Che , a co-anchor of the show s Weekend Update segment and one of its head writers . I always feel like the one good thing about Saturday Night Live , is it s always been kind of the time capsule of you know , American culture since it s been on the air and it s kind of hard to tell the story of American culture without talking about Donald Trump at least once a week . I mean , we talk about him 40 times a day , just in life , so you know , we re a show where we have a different type of responsibility . We do n t really just do 90 minutes of avant garde comedy but , I do n t know it would be hard . We d miss him I think . Subscribe to Variety Newsletters and Email Alerts !",

		"paragraph": "Rome ( AFP ) - Italy postponed high-level talks with France on Wednesday after Paris branded Rome irresponsible for refusing to take in a migrant rescue ship . Italy 's new economy minister postponed a meeting with his French counterpart in Paris as their countries traded barbs over the treatment of more than 600 migrants rescued off the Libyan coast at the weekend . The migrants were stranded on the Aquarius vessel until Spain said the ship could land at its port of Valencia . It is expected to arrive there later this week . French President Emmanuel Macron accused Italy 's new populist government of \" cynicism and irresponsibility \" for closing its ports to the 629 migrants . Rome called his comments \" unacceptable \" and summoned France 's ambassador on Wednesday . \" Such statements are undermining relations between Italy and France , \" Italy 's foreign ministry said in a statement . Macron later appealed for the two sides not to \" give in to emotions that certain people are manipulating \" . In a speech in the western French town of Mouchamps , he insisted that France was \" working hand in hand with Italy \" to handle migration . - Italy demands apology - Italy 's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini had suggested that a planned meeting between the leaders of the two countries should be cancelled if France did not issue an \" official apology \" . Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Macron are due to hold talks on Friday ahead of a European summit focussing on migration . \" If an official apology does n't arrive , Prime Minister Conte would be right not to go to France , \" Salvini told reporters . A French presidential source said the country had not received any formal demand from Italy for an apology . Italy 's new Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said he was cancelling a meeting with his French counterpart Bruno le Maire in Paris . The French economy ministry later said the ministers had \" agreed that Mr Tria will come to Paris in the coming days \" . - ' Axis of the willing ' - European Union member states are divided over how to deal with asylum seekers . Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz on Wednesday hailed cooperation between the hardline interior ministers of Austria , Germany and Italy on the issue . \" I think it marks very sensible cooperation that will contribute to reducing illegal migration to Europe , \" said Kurz , whose country assumes the EU 's rotating presidency on July 1 . \" We believe an axis of the willing is needed to fight illegal migration . \" EU leaders in December set an end-June deadline for an overhaul of rules to create a permanent mechanism to deal with migrants . The International Organisation for Migration on Tuesday warned against the closing of EU borders . \" I fear a major tragedy if states start refusing to accept rescued migrants , \" its director general William Lacy Swing said . - ' A sign of generosity ' - Salvini has repeatedly accused fellow EU members of abandoning Italy as it struggles to cope with migrants making the perilous journey from Africa across the Mediterranean . The country has seen more than 700,000 migrants arrive on its shores since 2013 . Under EU rules , migrants must apply for asylum in the European nation where they first arrive . Speaking to the Senate Wednesday , Salvini accused France of only receiving 640 of the 9,816 migrants it had promised to take from Italy . He said that between January and May , France had sent 10,249 migrants back to Italy . He demanded that France move from \" words to action and offer a sign of generosity \" by taking more in . Salvini has accused charities that rescue migrants of working with human traffickers but said Italy would not stop rescuing migrant boats itself . An Italian coastguard ship carrying more than 900 migrants was allowed to dock in Sicily on Wednesday . \" Closing ports , whoever does it , threatens rescue at sea , as we have seen in the case of the Aquarius , and therefore is not the right solution , \" UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told reporters in Geneva . But he stressed that \" the reason why Italy said it had closed ports is something we need to listen to \" .",

		"paragraph": "Despite warnings from gynecologists , women regularly turn to douches , vaginal wipes , and moisturizers to try to clean themselves below the belt . But a new study finds that women who use these products are three times more likely to contract a vaginal infection than those who do n t . For the study , which was published in the journal BMC Women s Health , researchers from the University of Guelph in Ontario surveyed nearly 1,500 Canadian women about their overall vaginal health , any products they used , and how often they had vaginal issues . A whopping 95 percent of the women surveyed reported using some type of vaginal product , with the most common being anti-itch creams , moisturizers and lubricants , and feminine wipes . The researchers found that women who use gel sanitizers are eight times more likely to have a yeast infection than those who do n t , and almost 20 times more likely to get a bacterial infection . Similarly , women who used feminine washes or gels are nearly 3.5 times more likely to have a bacterial infection and 2.5 times more likely to report a urinary tract infection . Those who use feminine wipes are twice as likely to have a UTI , and those who use lubricants or moisturizers are 2.5 times more likely to have a yeast infection . The researchers point out that it s hard to know whether the products themselves are causing the infections or whether the women are using the products to try to address their vaginal issues . But , they note , there is definitely a link . The news is n t shocking to experts . Many of these products contain fragrances or antiseptics that can disrupt the vaginal flora , the natural balance of bacteria that exists in the vagina , women s health expert Jennifer Wider , MD , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . When the balance is messed up , the result can make it easier for the ‘ bad bacteria to grow and cause an infection , she says . Feminine douches or washes are particularly concerning , Wider says , pointing out that the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists , and many health experts warn against it . Of course , it could be that some women are resorting to using these products when they already have an issue . There are women who will self-treat if they have a vaginal discharge or odor , Jessica Shepherd , MD , a minimally invasive gynecologist at Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . But then they re not getting to the source of the issue and are just masking it or even exacerbating it . The vagina and vulvar region are self-cleaning , making all of these products unnecessary , Christine Greves , MD , a board-certified ob-gyn at the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies in Orlando , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . Your vaginal microbiome is helpful at preventing infections like bacterial vaginosis and yeast infections , she says . But it s very sensitive , and feminine products can inevitably affect that area , especially if you put them inside your vagina . It s important for women to understand that it s normal for the vagina to have a slight odor , Shepherd says . It s usually a slight musky smell , but it should n t be overwhelming , she says . If it varies from that , you need to let your doctor know . If you re concerned about your normal vaginal odor , Wider recommends showering regularly and using a small amount of mild , unscented soap with water on your external genitalia only . Certain infections , like bacterial vaginosis , can cause a strong vaginal odor that need a doctor s care , Greves points out , and masking it with a product is n t going to fix the underlying problem . So , if you notice that your vaginal scent is off or you have another vaginal issue that you ve been attempting to self-treat , see your ob-gyn . They should be able to help .

		"paragraph": "Thirty-five years ago , on July 27 , 1983 , a woman named Madonna Louise Ciccone released her self-titled debut album , and it soon launched not just a music revolution , but a fashion revolution as well . The disc s stark black-and-white artwork Madonna clasping her unforgettable face between bracelet-stacked hands on the front , wrapping a thick dog-chain necklace around her throat on the back comprised some of the most striking pop imagery of the 80s . It was n t long before every little girl in the world wanted to be Madonna ( or a Madonnabe ) , bedecking themselves with oversized lace hair bows , crucifixes , stacks of rubber bangles , and , much to their parents chagrin , Boy Toy belts and visible bras . But Madonna did n t come up with her early signature look entirely on her own . She had a lucky star on her side back then , a visionary stylist , who helped craft that image . And that woman also went by a singular name : Maripol . Without Maripol a French-expat artist , jewelry designer , photographer , film producer , and NYC girl-about - ( down ) town Madonna may never have become MADONNA . After all , Maripol was the woman who introduced street-style jelly bracelets to the mainstream ( fun fact : Grace Jones was the first pop singer to wear Maripol s rubber creations , on her ankles ) , and she was the woman who first convinced Madonna to dance onstage in a bra . Speaking to Yahoo Entertainment from New York , Maripol humbly , grudgingly concedes , Whatever , yes I did create a legend . Recalling the night that started it all , at New York hip-hop club the Roxy almost four decades ago , she says , There was a lot of mix of culture coming from England , with people like Bow Wow Wow , and then there was Fab Five Freddy , from Yo ! MTV Raps , which was also the beginning of this whole movement . Fab Five Freddy asked me if I could find cute girls , and I turned around and saw Madonna and asked her if she would want to go onstage . I asked her if she had a nice bra on , and she thought I was out of my mind ! I asked her to actually take her top off . And the rest is history . So , was that the unofficial beginning of the underwear-as-outerwear trend ? No , that was the beginning of the fact that I m French ! I was less puritan than anyone else , and I was always taking my clothes off , unfortunately , Maripol laughs . After that , Madonna actually made an appointment to come see me in my loft , because she wanted me to create her look . … I had already invented the rubber bracelet , and I was the art director of Fiorucci , and I thought that she was the perfect person to carry around my style . And it was perfect for her as well . Maripol and Madonna s first fashion collaboration was for the Madonna album cover , on which Maripol s bold , punky jewelry was practically as much the star as Madonna herself . Maripol s involvement in Madonna s early career opened many doors for the singer . For instance , there was the night that Madonna , at the time still a total unknown , performed at Fiorucci s 15th anniversary soiree a booking that Maripol , the art director for the trendsetting Italian boutique in the late 70s and early 80s , had to fight for . I had a big budget , and I kept saying to my boss , ‘ I want this singer . Everybody was like , ‘ No , no , who is that , who is Madonna ? We want the girl who played in Flashdance , Jennifer Beals . And I m like , ‘ Jennifer Beals ? She is not a singer ! Finally , I won . I had a big rubber cake with 15 candles and Madonna to jump out of it , and Madonna jumped out that day . The club was packed , and she got the manager of Michael Jackson [ Ron Weisner ] to come , and I think he signed her right there on the spot . Maripol maintained a massive influence on Madonna s style during the subsequent Like a Virgin era , more than once stopping her star client and friend from becoming a fashion victim . Recalling the cover shoot for the breakthrough sophomore album , Maripol says : The art director had this idea , which was to have the black Sabbath-type virgin . You know , like black lipstick , black this , black that . And I kept saying to her , ‘ We should go for the real thing , come on ! ' Eventually Madonna wore her VMAs-immortalized white wedding dress ( more on that in a bit ) , and the result was yet another iconic album cover . Maripol also stepped in when she thought the stage costumes for 1984 s Virgin Tour were , well , a little too Prince-ly . There was a designer , a really nice English girl , Marlene Stewart . And Marlene designed everything [ for the tour ] very Purple Rain . And I went to Madonna and she showed me everything and I said , ‘ Madonna , you re Madonna . Why do n t you keep a bit of what you have ? And she listened to me . Madonna s peekaboo bridal gown still stands as one of her most memorable looks , of course . Older generations may vividly recall the exact moment when they first saw Elvis twitch his pelvis on TV or when the Beatles first performed on Ed Sullivan , but for children of the 80s , the defining televised music moment was when Madonna kicked off the first annual MTV Video Music Awards in 1984 . No one had ever seen anything like it at the time , and Maripol was there to see it in person . At first , it seemed like the racy performance might be career suicide for Madonna , Maripol recalls . I was right there , I saw it happening . I saw what [ MTV ] did , and I can tell you that they tried to destroy her that day . They went under her skirt with the camera they were trying to intimidate her . But of course , the stunt instead stratospherically catapulted Madonna to superstar status . Madonna had to break through I knew she was going to make it big , because I could see how ambitious she was , in a very genuine and sweet way . The wedding outfit did help . I knew that day that she had made it , says Maripol . Every journalist was rushing , running , going , ‘ Oh my God , who is this girl with the white outfit rolling and crawling on the floor , with crosses in her ears and her name is Madonna ? And she s singing about being like a virgin ? They were shocked , yes . Once the aforementioned Madonnabes came out in full force and took over malls everywhere , Maripol had mixed feelings about the trends she d helped create . One time , when judging a Madonna lookalike contest in 1985 with none other than Andy Warhol at Macy s ( amusingly , the department store that would carry Madonna s own Material Girl fashion line decades later ) , Maripol was conflicted . I saw those young girls , and it was sad . They wanted to mimic Madonna , and they were so young . It was all about the fun and stuff but … oh my God , she sighs . Perhaps Maripol had mixed feelings over the fact that she never really got full credit for her pop-culture influence . When mall shops ripped off and mass-produced her designs , Maripol ended up broke . If only I would have been smart , if only you could copyright the look which I do n t even know if it existed back then I would have been a multimillionaire , for sure , she says . I did go bankrupt because everybody copied me , every single industry . But genuinely , it does n t matter . I swear I do n t care . I became a freelance stylist to survive , and then I had a kid . I bankrupted in 1988 and had a kid in 1990 . I m very happy I have a beautiful son now . Eventually the chameleonic Madonna changed her style , many times over , and while Maripol was still involved with Madonna s later looks the sleek bustier outfit Madonna wore for her Marilyn Monroe-esque makeover in the Papa Do n t Preach video and the rubber dress she wore in the Express Yourself video s milk-lapping scene were both Maripol creations eventually Madonna moved on to other designers ( like Jean-Paul Gaultier , who created her early - 90s cone bra ) . I think Madonna might have a multiple personality . I know you [ think I am kidding ] , but I think it goes with the pain of losing your mother so young [ at age 5 ] . Multiple personality that s my theory , Maripol muses . But that is really excellent for her career , because she decides to really change her look , so people will never get bored of her . It s a genius strategy . She says she changes her music , but come on , the music has always been the same . Maripol has certainly kept busy in past years . Among her many endeavors , she has released four art books , most recently Maripola X , a collection of erotic Polaroids from the 1980s . I have a very young publisher , Adele Jancovici , and we really love each other and she s very smart , and I trusted her to open my secret box , she says of that book . They re all very sexy pictures of that period , of me mostly , but a lot of other people too . There is one for the first album cover of Madonna that was rejected by the record company that was never used . It s a genuinely beautiful picture of her , but it was not in line with Madonna as we knew her , with all the rubber and being like a little punky . We had beautiful pictures with her with sheets around her , beautiful lights and makeup , but they were all rejected . Maripol has also art-directed music videos for Cher , D Angelo , Elton John , and Luther Vandross contributed regularly to Document magazine collaborated on a line of vintage-inspired jewelry and T-shirts with Marc Jacobs launched a jewelry line called Atomic Glamour and directed Arte Creative s Keith Haring documentary , The Message . I also have multiple personalities , the artist laughs . With such a bustling career , Maripol once again stresses that she harbors no resentment toward Madonna , reasoning , I m very happy for her . And you know what ? In a way , I got the freedom to walk around in the street , and she does n t have that . And I think it s very difficult for her to not be able to have that freedom . Once you lose that freedom , does that make you more happy in life ? I ve always kept good relation with her and I really wish her the immense best , and I will get my claim of fame eventually .

		"paragraph": "It s been more than 25 years since Nicole Kidman had an ectopic pregnancy , but it seems that the pain is still just as raw . In a heart-wrenching interview with British society magazine Tatler , the mother of four opened up about the grief she felt after losing her first child at age 23 , and why she feels the devastating topic is still treated as taboo . Kidman , now 50 , was newly married to first husband Tom Cruise when she learned her pregnancy was ectopic , which is when a fertilized egg is implanted outside the womb . A second pregnancy near the end of the former couple s marriage resulted in a miscarriage . I know the yearning , the Australian actress told the magazine . That yearning . It s a huge , aching yearning . And the loss ! The loss of a miscarriage is not talked about enough . That s massive grief to certain women . Kidman and Cruise who were married for 10 years ended up adopting their now-grown kids , Isabella and Connor Cruise . There s an enormous amount of pain and an enormous amount of joy on the other side of it , she said , describing the feeling of finally becoming a parent . The flip side of going through so much yearning and pain to get there is the feeling of ‘ Ahhhh ! when you have the child . After splitting from Cruise and marrying country singer Keith Urban in 2006 , the actress went on to have two daughters , Sunday Rose , 9 , and Faith Margaret , 7 . Faith was born via a surrogate . You can read Kidman s full interview in the July issue of Tatler , available by digital download and on newsstands now .

A little bit of Lionel Richie Dancing on the Ceiling action , courtesy of Lil Buck , plus Sia s Move Your Body make this one stand out . Mr. Clean , Cleaner of Your Dreams Mr. Clean s butt jiggles . There are uncountable instances of female boobs and butts jiggling in the history of animation , but you can count the number of animated dudes as sex objects on one hand . Women deserve to have awkward feelings about attractive cartoons the same way men have for years ! Kudos , Mr. Clean . Wix.com , Big Game A Super Bowl commercial should feel like an event , and this one does . It feels like a tiny Jason Statham movie , which is perfect because Jason Statham movies often feel like oversized Super Bowl ads . There s a little story that continues in part two , and the product ( a website-building service ) is integrated into the action . It s not a game-changer it just does everything right . Skittles , Romance Katie eating the Skittles is both cute and funny . Then the mom makes it weird . Dad makes it weirder . Grandma makes it funny and weird . The robber makes it funny again . Cop makes it weird by enjoying the Skittle a little too much , and the beaver is just there because the NFL charges a fee if you do n t have at least one adorable animal per commercial . This spot is a roller coaster of emotion . Febreze , Halftime #Bathroombreak Classy talk about poop . It s simple , it works , and it s perfectly on brand for what the product does : Febreze cleans up the stink . The extended cut online of this is a thing of beauty one segment features the sounds of eating and slurping that are both disgusting and hilarious . Bud Light , Between Friends This is as close as Bud Light gets ( and as close as it should get ) to sappiness , and it s a solid effort . A wedding toast made up of out-of-context moments from the lives of two bros . It s nailed down by the schlockiest ( in the worst/best way ) piano cover of Guns N Roses imaginable . Budweiser , Born the Hard Way A great reminder that almost every American is descended from immigrant stock . Busch , BUSCHHHH And this is how you elevate a dumb idea into something great . The moderately embarrassed look on the spokesman s face the judging stares of the wildlife the buschhhhh sound , which is kind of like a fart and kind of like peeing , but is n t either , so it s not crass . Sometimes , it s about the little things . Audi , Daughter Say what you want about the culture wars , but if you re rooting against a scrappy girl winning a soapbox race , something s wrong with you . That emergency brake move makes this commercial feel like it was directed by John Frankenheimer . T-Mobile , #UnlimitedMoves Once again , the show is stolen by a little girl . She outdances Gronk ( to be expected ) , TO ( a tough , but not unwinnable match-up ) , and Justin Bieber himself ( who even busted out the fabled shimmity sham sham shimmity shake ) . Also , did Bieber just learn the word hello ? When the word tumbles out of his mouth , he sounds like a disoriented baby squirrel . Squarespace , Calling John Malkovich It is a uniquely modern problem and one that virtually everyone has experienced in one form or another from having to go with JohnSmith99461@gmail.com to realizing that the URL for your dream snack company for dogs , Snack My Bichon Up , has been taken . Of course , there s also the possibility that this commercial exists in the Being John Malkovich world , where everybody is named John Malkovich , in which case , this spot got real sad real quick . Ford , Go Further Monday morning water cooler talk will undoubtedly center around which stuck scenario everybody identified with most . For us , it s the kid with the Big Wheel . Avocados From Mexico , Secret Society Sure , evil conspiracies have been done to death , but Kyle , are you streaming this ? and a half-hilarious/half-terrifying subliminal appearance by John Lovitz kinda has us thinking that maybe there is a shade of Grey missing . Give us back our missing shade , you Illuminati jerks ! Airbnb , #WeAccept Even if you do n t remember Godly and Creme s Cry , this ad still has a real throwback vibe . Like Coke , it s pushing back against anti-immigration sentiment with a simple message of togetherness .

Cue the angry President Trump tweets in 3 … 2 … 1 … Tide , Bradshaw Stain Back in the day , commercials used to be completely integrated into the television shows they were shown on . It s the origin of the term soap opera , and it s fitting that Tide brings a little of that flavor back with its ad featuring commentator Terry Bradshaw with a big ol meatball stain on his chest . His quest for a clean shirt is perfectly capped by Jeffrey Tambor giving the most dismissive I du n no in history . NFL , Super Bowl Babies Does this need any explanation ? Dressing up babies as football greats will melt any heart . Seriously . Charles Manson , Vladimir Putin … any heart . Mike Ditka , Michael Irvin , Joe Namath , Tom Brady , Bill Belichick , Marshawn Lynch , and Von Miller should be as proud of their tiny doppelgangers as anything they ve done in their Hall of Fame-worthy careers . Intel , Brady Everyday Famous athlete + mild self-deprecation + adorable dog = a Super Bowl commercial . Intel is n t really selling anything , as far as we can tell . It just does n t want anybody to think , Hey , whatever happened to Intel ? Mission accomplished . Bud Light , Ghost Spuds It s a fun idea a Dickens Christmas Carol , only for parties . But everybody knows that Spuds MacKenzie was played by a female dog ( RIP Evie ) . Giving her that deep , dude s dude voice is jarring and moderately unpleasant . Mercedes , Easy Driver Visually , it s as perfect as you d expect from the Coen Brothers . The set is beautiful , the biker gags are spot-on . But Peter Fonda looks like he d rather be waterboarded than be in this commercial , and he turns his face away from the camera so much , you begin to suspect that a stand-in was used for half the shots . Honda , Yearbooks They just put Peter Cushing and a 19-year-old Carrie Fisher into a live-action Star Wars movie , so there s no excuse for the animation of these celebrity yearbook pictures to look this bad . Everything s great about this spot except for the fact that all the celebs faces slide into the dreaded Uncanny Valley . Snickers , Live Was this actually done live ? The fake choreographed destruction looks too good to be real . On the other hand , we re in a world where OK Go exists if it can turn four seconds of explosions into a three-minute slow-mo video , anything is possible . If it was live , it was a pure win if it was fake , then it s just another commercial . Give us proof , Snickers ! Show us alternate angles ! We demand film from the nougaty knoll ! GoDaddy , The Internet Wants You Hey , remember GoDaddy ? The company that made commercials that were basically soft-core pornography before they decided to rebrand ? And now they re trying to sell nostalgia for five-year-old cat videos because their demo went from early 20s males to the over-50 crowd in a few short years ? Remember ? Yeah , neither do we . Turbo Tax , Humpty Fall There s a point in this commercial where it could still work out OK . The shattered face is disgusting , but it s an egg , not a person the cockney accent keeps it hovering in comedy territory . But then Humpty vomits yolk out of his mouth , and the whole thing becomes a horrifying , grotesque monstrosity . Buick , Not So Pee Wee Football Sometimes , it just comes down to execution . Properly done , this would be a fun spot with a comically oversized pro athlete playing with children , but it s got the production values of a local used-car commercial . Tiffany & Co. , Introducing Lady Gaga for Tiffany HardWear WHAT ARE YOU SELLING ? WHY MUST I GOOGLE YOUR COMMERCIAL TO FIND OUT WHAT YOUR COMMERCIAL IS FOR ? WHY DO THESE KINDS OF SPOTS EXIST ? Yellow Tail Wine , Wan na Pet My Roo ? Yellow Tail is doing its country no favors with this ad featuring pretty much every Australian stereotype imaginable . Drunken partiers ? Check . Women in bikinis ? Check . Animatronic kangaroos ? It was n t a stereotype before , but it ll probably be now . You half expect this wine to taste like the light beer whose style this commercial is trying to emulate . Bai , #BaiBaiBai Oh , come on . Justin Timberlake still has a thriving solo career . What is he doing in this ad spoofing an * NSYNC song ? There are four other dudes who could use the money more . And speaking of money … you could wallpaper the Sistine Chapel with the royalty checks Christopher Walken has collected for saying ordinary things in his distinctive voice .

A North Branford , Connecticut , man who was one of four people charged for the 2014 hacking scandal , related to a phishing scheme in which he obtained illegal access to over 100 Apple and Google email accounts , including some belonging to celebrities , has been sentenced to prison . According to a press release , George Garofano , 26 , was sentenced to eight months in prison , followed by three years of supervised release . Garofano , who has been released on a $ 50,000 bond , was also ordered by U.S. District Judge Victor A. Bolden in Bridgeport to report to prison on Oct. 10 , 2018 , as well as serve 60 hours of community service . U.S. Attorney John H. Durham said in the release that Garofano admitted that he sent e-mails to victims that appeared to be from security accounts of Apple and encouraged the victims to send him their usernames and passwords , or to enter them on a third-party website , where he would later retrieve them . Garofano 's sentence stems from an investigation of the September 2014 Celebgate hacks , in which nude photographs of stars like Jennifer Lawrence , Kirsten Dunst , and Meagan Good were distributed online without their consent . In April , Garofano pleaded guilty one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information . Following the hack , Lawrence called the act a \" sex crime , \" as well as opened up about living in fear and feeling violated . When the hacking thing happened it was so unbelievably violating that you ca n t even put into words , she said on The Hollywood Reporter s Awards Chatter podcast in 2017 . I think that I m still actually processing . Describing the scenario like a ransom , Lawrence went on to say , I feel like I got gang banged by the f**king planet . There s not one person in the world that s not capable of seeing these intimate photos of me . You could be at a barbeque and somebody could just pull it up on their phone and that was just a really impossible thing to process . The Red Sparrow star also added that many women came to her following the hack , wanting her to join them in lawsuits surrounding the ordeal . None of that was going to bring me peace , she said . None of that was going to bring my nude body back to me and Nick [ Hoult ] , the person they were intended for . It was n t going to bring any of that back . I was n t interested in suing everybody .

		"paragraph": "John Goodman is opening up about the cancellation of Roseanne , but the celebrated actor is being cautious about his comments regarding the controversy . In recent footage obtained by ET , Goodman was at an auto repair shop in New Orleans where he was collecting his car after repairs . The actor was reluctant to address the drama , explaining that he would \" rather say nothing than to cause more trouble . \" However , the 65-year-old actor -- who played Roseanne Barr 's on-screen husband , Dan Conner , on the ABC sitcom -- assured fans that he 's doing OK amid the controversy , sharing , \" Everything 's fine . \" The actor also seemed pretty content with ABC deciding to suspend its Emmys For Your Consideration campaign for the show s recent 10th season , which means that none of the cast or creators would likely see any love from this year 's Emmy Awards . \" I was n't gon na get an Emmy anyway , \" Goodman said , shrugging . \" I 've been up there [ 11 ] times already , and if I did n't get one I 'm not gon na get one . \" Goodman was nominated for 11 Emmys between 1988 and 2010 -- six of which were for his role on Roseanne . Goodman did take home one Emmy in 2007 for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his role on the short-lived series Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip . The sitcom also earned the veteran TV star five Golden Globe nominations , of which he won once , in 1993 . Goodman said he has n't been following the news of the developing controversy regarding Roseanne , stating , \" I do n't know anything about it . I do n't read it . \" That includes rumors and speculation that the show could possibly continue in the future in the form of a spin-off , if Barr 's titular character was written off , and the focus was shifted to Goodman 's character . The actor said of the rumors , \" Then you 've heard more than I have . \" The long , contentious drama between Barr and ABC began early Tuesday morning when the 65-year-old actress posted a racist tweet regarding former White House adviser Valerie Jarrett , which she then deleted . Later Tuesday morning , ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey released a statement announcing that the network had cancelled Roseanne in response to the outrage surrounding Barr 's remark . ABC subsequently removed all references to the revival series on its press site and Viacom pulled all re-runs of the sitcom 's entire run from all of its channels . Barr declared that she was going to leave Twitter on Tuesday morning , only to return in the evening with a late-night tweet storm that blamed her original offending tweet on Ambien , and then called out several of her co-stars for throwing her \" under the bus . \" For more on the on-going controversy -- including the fallout Barr is facing for her comments -- check out the video below .

[ Join a Yahoo Daily Fantasy Baseball contest now ] According to Tom Haudricourt of the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel , Jonathan Lucroy has elected to exercise his no-trade clause and veto a trade to the Cleveland Indians that would have brought four prospects back to Milwaukee . For the time being anyway , Lucroy is still with the Brewers , though there s still time for Milwaukee to swing another trade and there s still time for Cleveland to convince Lucroy to change his mind . In fact , it s reported that effort is well underway right now . It s almost certain Lucroy will require a new contract agreement to agree to a trade to a team on his no-trade list . The 30-year-old catcher earned a $ 4M salary this season and has a $ 5.2 M team option next season that Yahoo Sports Jeff Passan reports Lucroy would like to see torn up . For now , Lucroy is still with the Brewers in Milwaukee as they prepare to face the Pittsburgh Pirates . He was also available to the media , but shed little light on the circumstances of his decision . By vetoing the trade , Lucroy could be back in play for teams like the New York Mets and Texas Rangers , who were aggressive suitors prior to Cleveland emerging as the temporary winner . Another team could also emerge from the rubble to pull off a stunner . With some leverage potentially lost though , it s possible Milwaukee wo n t receive as strong a return . There are obviously a lot of variables involved , and there s still nearly 30 hours to get it sorted out . But we d say the trade deadline just got real .

		"paragraph": "Model Kate Upton is further explaining the sexual harassment allegations she made towards Guess co-founder Paul Marciano , saying , I m not going to let him intimidate me anymore . Upton first made the claims in a Jan. 31 tweet that read , It s disappointing that such an iconic women s brand @Guess is still empowering Paul Marciano as their creative director #metoo . She also shared the same message on Instagram , writing , He should n t be allowed to use his power in the industry to sexually and emotionally harass women #metoo . After Upton s disclosures , Marciano sent a statement to TMZ , saying in part , This accusation is false . I have never touched Kate Upton . I have never been alone with Kate Upton . I have never acted inappropriately towards her . On Wednesday , the 25-year-old model gave a powerful interview to Time , revealing abusive treatment from the fashion mogul , starting from when she was 18 . In a statement to Time , however , Marciano denied the allegations . I have never been alone with Kate Upton , he said . I have never touched her inappropriately . Nor would I ever refer to a Guess model in such a derogatory manner . Marciano added , I fully support the #MeToo movement . At the same time , I will not allow others to defame me and tarnish my reputation . I have pledged to Guess and its board of directors my full support and cooperation with a fair and impartial investigation . In the Time interview , Upton described her first day of work in July 2010 for a Guess lingerie campaign . Paul Marciano said he wanted to meet with me , she said . As soon as I walked in with photographer Yu Tsai , Paul came straight up to me , forcibly grabbed my breasts and started feeling them playing with them , actually . After I pushed him away , he said , ‘ I m making sure they re real . Upton continued , Despite doing everything I could physically do to avoid his touch throughout the meeting , he continued to touch me in a very dominating and aggressive way , grabbing my thighs , my arms to pull me closer , my shoulders to pull me closer , my neck , my breasts , and smelling me . He then told Yu Tsai to leave us alone . I was able to send a quick text to Yu Tsai asking him to stay . He did , but that did not stop Paul s constant grabbing . I was extremely shaken , surprised , and scared . At one point he forcibly grabbed the back of my head so that I could not move and started kissing my face and my neck . I remember not wanting to say ‘ Get off of me because I did n t want to open my mouth to say anything because I did n t want him to be able to put his tongue in my mouth . I had two options : Do everything I could to wiggle away and avoid his pursuit , or punch the CEO of Guess . So I decided to just wiggle away . Upton described how Marciano insisted on walking her to her hotel room , but the photographer intervened . I was so relieved and felt like I had barely escaped , she said . One month later , Upton accepted another Guess shoot and once in her hotel room , she says Marciano called several times asking to visit . After several denials , I just turned off my phone and locked the door and tried to get some sleep , she said . I was terrified . All I could think was if he was able to get into my room it would not be good . The following day , Upton says she was fired from the shoot . Someone had called my agency to say I had gotten fat and would not be needed on set [ that day ] , she said . I was devastated , especially because at this point no one from Guess had even seen me . Still , Guess continued offering Upton work , and she agreed , asking her photographer friend to intervene . We came up with a plan that anytime Paul invites himself to my room , I would text Yu Tsai to be there so that I was never alone in a room with him . I was still very nervous and scared because clearly Paul was comfortable with touching me in front of him . But Yu Tsai assured me that he would look out for me , so that s what we did . Upton also suggested that Marciano played mind games , offering her work , but not booking her until the last minute . It made me feel that if I cut off communication with him , I would n t be booked again , she explained . Paul s texting increased , telling me how excited he was to see me , that he wanted me to change in front of him so he could see my naked body getting into his clothes . He asked if I thought of him when I was posing sexy on set . She added , All the language he used was extremely dominant and possessive . At one point , to avoid Paul coming to set , I told him my boyfriend was going to be there . He was absolutely furious at that . It was an emotional and nonstop battle of games , power struggles , and creative avoidance tactics . After Tsai was fired , Marciano retaliated , says Upton . That s when I worked with the photographer Ellen von Unwerth . Paul s behavior became much more aggressive without Yu Tsai there as a buffer . My denials to Paul had to be much more direct . Then I was told the morning of the shoot I was not needed on set and was fired again . Upton s final Guess shoot took place during which she alleges Marciano called her disgusting and spread rumors that she was drinking on set , which Upton denied . She said , I was then told to leave because Paul had said , ‘ Get that fat pig off my set . The model went on to work for Sports Illustrated , and in 2012 , Guess reached out with a $ 400,000 gig the company s highest offer ever , says Upton which she cautiously accepted , and then refused at the last minute . The supermodel says her experience with Marciano affected her self-esteem . I constantly blamed myself after it happened : What am I doing to invite someone to treat me like that or grab me like that ? she said . I wondered if it was how I was presenting myself or what I was wearing . I started slumping my shoulders to hide my breast size , wearing baggy clothes , started despising my own body . She continued : I m sick of being silenced and expected to sweep everything under the rug . I m sick of being expected to laugh off these aggressive advances and accept the power imbalances that exist . I m sick of being expected to endure all of this while being polite and professional through it all . She adds : Paul used his power to make me feel insecure and powerless , but I m not going to let him intimidate me anymore . These men think they are untouchable , but times are changing .

		"paragraph": "Did you ever want to caddie for a PGA Tour winner ? Well , this was your chance . And you probably blew it . Steven Bowditch took to Twitter on Monday night to seek someone to carry his bag at this week s John Deere Classic . And he did it in the self-deprecating fashion we ve come to expect from the two-time PGA Tour winner as he gave himself only a 1-percent chance of making it to Sunday 's final round . Talk about the ultimate temp job . Although , it does n t necessarily have to be so temporary . One responder asked whether he could also caddie for Bowditch at next week s Open Championship if the Aussie happens to win this week and qualify for the season s third major . Without doubt . Not even a question , Bowditch replied . RELATED : Steven Bowditch is still the funniest PGA Tour pro on Twitter By Tuesday afternoon , Bowditch had settled on his caddie , a 17-year-old local named Elias , who gave a sweet and savvy ( \" I love Australia \" ) response . After winning the Byron Nelson in 2015 and representing the Internationals at the President Cup later that year , Bowditch has struggled mightily with his golf game . He has n't made a cut in five tournaments this season and has failed to make the weekend in 35 of his past 37 starts . However , the talent is still in there somewhere , and there is still the potential for a big payday for both him and the lucky looper . Standard PGA Tour caddie payouts are roughly 5 percent of tournament earnings for a made cut , 7 percent for a top 10 , and 10 percent of a win . This week 's winner will make more than $ 1 million , so you do the math for what the winning caddie takes home . Not a bad week 's work -- if you can get it . Good luck , Elias .

		"paragraph": "With more networks and streaming services getting into original programming everyday , the demand for televised content is greater than ever . In Adapt This ! we spotlight a piece of previously unadapted material we d love to see become a TV series and even suggest a potential network and creative team . The Handmaid s Tale Source Material : Margaret Atwood s 1985 novel features one of the most chilling dystopias ever created , one that at the time and still today functions as a powerful and necessary argument in favor of women s rights . Thumbnail Synopsis : Unhappy with America s increasingly progressive direction , a devoutly right-wing faction of the government successfully executes a coup that results in the founding of the Republic of Gilead . In this brave new world , women are subjugated to the will and authority of men and divided into eight distinct classes . Wives are perched atop this government-mandated social strata , followed by daughters and then handmaids , a concubine class tasked with the job of continuing the human race , as sterility is on the rise . Atwood s narrative is framed as the life and times of one particular handmaiden , Offred , who , in another life before the fall , had a family of her own . Now , she lives in the unhappy home of the high-ranking Commander and his bitter wife , Serena Joy , a one-time televangelist who preached the gospel the men of Gilead claim to be honoring . Related : Why Spider-Girl Needs Her Own Series Why It Would Make Great TV : For starters , Atwood s prose is so vivid , you can see the television series in your mind s eye while reading the book . And then there s Gilead itself , a multi-layered world that s idyllic on the surface and rotten at the core . During the course of the novel , the author expertly peels away the lies and hypocrisies this society is founded on , while at the same time setting Offred on a journey towards empowerment . It s a slow-burn arc that benefits from the kind of breathing room that a limited series can provide . Each episode could take the time to flesh out the conventions and customs of Gilead , from The Ceremony ( the union of Commander and Handmaiden , where the latter lies on top of the Wife while the man attends to business ) to the schools where stern Aunts train the next generation of concubines . Entire episodes could also be given over to key chapters in the novel , including the elaborate preparations for one handmaiden s ritual birth , as well as the Commander s night out with Offred at a brothel , where she encounters a familiar face from her past . With more screen time comes more opportunities to preserve the rich details and nuance in Atwood s prose that s one of the many reasons why the deservedly forgotten 1990 movie version of The Handmaid s Tale failed . That film , which starred Natasha Richardson as Offred and Robert Duvall as the Commander , efficiently recreated the broad outlines of the world described on the page , without really communicating what makes Atwood s dystopia so unsettling the notion that it could happen here . Given that it was written in the mid - ‘ 80s , when the so-called Moral Majority was in its ascendency and strictly enforcing traditional definitions of marriage and gender roles , The Handmaid s Tale should ideally feel a relic in an age where American society has made enormous strides towards true equality between the sexes . And yet , the pointed belittling of female politicians ( be it Hillary Clinton or Sarah Palin ) , the dwindling access in certain states to lawful reproductive rights , and the challenges women face in reporting sexual violence on college campuses continue to illustrate Handmaid s relevance . ( The parallels to some of the more theocratic Middle Eastern societies are all too apparent and timely as well . ) The Handmaid s Tale and George Orwell s 1984 are often yoked together because their respective dystopias hold a mirror up to our own past and present . But where the dominant emotion in 1984 is terror , Offred s rebellion is ultimately driven by anger anger that her body , her history , and her personhood has been reclaimed by a male-dominated ruling class more concerned with dictating her behavior than their own . Creative Dream Team : The big-screen version of The Handmaid s Tale was a stolid , stiff adaptation , but the series ca n t and should n t be that coldly clinical even if Gilead prizes dutiful restraint over forceful individualism . Enter Jill Soloway , creator of Amazon s breakout series Transparent and the uneven , but deeply felt indie film , Afternoon Delight . Both are constructed around the idea of women Kathryn Hahn s frustrated stay-at-home mom in Afternoon Delight and Jeffry Tambor s evolving Moppa in Transparent butting up against society s expectations of them . Purposefully messy and imprecise , Soloway s work achieves the lasting resonance you d want from an adaptation of The Handmaid s Tale . Given their past collaborations , Hahn would seem like a natural candidate for Offred , but she d actually make a better Moira an important friend from the heroine s past . That clears the lead role for Sarah Paulson , freeing her from the American Horror Story machine and handing her the role that will finally win her an Emmy . Ideal Network : HBO is the only logical place , seeing as how they have the budget this kind of adaptation requires , as well as the tradition of prestige miniseries based on popular books ( see also : Mildred Pierce and The Casual Vacancy ) and the interest in provocative sexual content as demonstrated by all the boobs ‘ n butts on your average episode of Game of Thrones . The Handmaid s Tale is available for purchase ( or as a free Kindle edition ) on Amazon .",

		"paragraph": "Investigators are trying to piece together how a \" suicidal \" ground worker at Seattle 's main airport managed to steal an empty turboprop passenger plane , conduct a series of loops while chased by US Air Force F-15s before crashing it into a small island in the Puget Sound . Authorities have refused to name the 29-year-old suspect pilot , referred to as \" Rich \" and \" Richard \" by air traffic controllers as they tried to coax him towards the ground during the hour-long incident . However US media have named him as Richard Russell , who is presumed to have died in the crash . Airline officials said the man was an employee of Horizon Air , part of the Alaska Airlines group , with more than three years experience . He had clearance to be around aircraft , with ground crew guiding planes , handling bags and de-ice aircraft , but no pilot 's licence . The aircraft taken , a Bombardier Q400 aircraft , usually carries 76 passengers . There was no connection to terrorism of any kind , officials said . Authorities said the man went through various background checks to get clearance to be in the secured area . But the incident will revive the debate about background checks for staff , particularly those being given access to such areas . The US has about 900,000 aviation workers , according to the most recent federal data and the checks required varying dependent on the job . The man used a machine called a pushback tractor to first manoeuvre the aircraft 180 degrees so he could taxi to the runway and take off during rush-hour at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport at about 8 pm on Friday local time . Authorities said it was unclear how he gained the skills to do loops in the aircraft before crashing . The unauthorised flight - which was captured on video - grounded all planes at the airport for a time . Ed Troyer , Pierce County Sheriff s Department spokesman , described the alleged pilot as a \" suicidal \" man doing stunts in the air before the crash . The aircraft slammed into Ketron Island about an hour later , authorities said , triggering an intense blaze . The wooded island , about 25 miles southwest from the airport has a population of about 20 people . There were no reports of injuries on the ground . The man could be heard on audio recordings telling air traffic controllers that he is just a broken guy . There is a runway just off to your right side in about a mile , the controller says , referring to an airfield at Joint Base Lewis-McChord . Oh man . Those guys will rough me up if I try and land there , the man responded , later adding This is probably jail time for life , huh ? Later the man said : I 've got a lot of people that care about me . It 's going to disappoint them to hear that I did this ... Just a broken guy , got a few screws loose , I guess . Pierce County Sheriff Paul Pastor said the man \" did something foolish and may well have paid with his life . Debra Eckrote , the Western Pacific regional chief for the National Transportation Safety Board , said : It is highly fragmented . The wings are off , the fuselage is , I think , kind of positioned upside down . Investigators are hopeful they will be able to recover both the cockpit voice recorder and the event data recorder from the plane . At a news conference in Seattle-Tacoma International Airport , officials from Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air said that they are still working closely with authorities as they investigate what happened . Safety is our number one goal , said Brad Tilden , CEO of Alaska Airlines . Last night 's event is going to push us to learn what we can from this tragedy so that we can ensure this does not happen again at Alaska Air Group or at any other airline . The FBI is leading the investigation and is looking into the man 's background to try to determine his motive . Seattle FBI agent in charge Jay Tabb Jr cautioned that the investigation would take a lot of time , and details , including the employee 's name , would not be released officially right away . Dozens of personnel were out at the crash site , and co-workers and family members were being interviewed , he said . Sarah Huckabee Sanders , White House Press Secretary , said on Saturday morning that Donald Trump was monitoring the situation .",

The United States women s national team had just been eliminated from the Rio Olympics prematurely a 1-1 quarterfinal tie , eventually lost to Sweden on penalties so it was time for another tirade by the Americans controversial goalkeeper . She told reporters that the U.S. had played a courageous game . That the U.S. had showed a lot of heart and American heart . And that Sweden had been a bunch of cowards because they did n t want to play great soccer . Certainly , Sweden had sat in and preyed on the counter for all 120 minutes of its game against the U.S. And for a lot of those minutes , it did n t even really look to attack at all , instead absorbing pressure and letting the American waves wash up on its defensive dunes . It knew full well that they were outmatched . Their head coach , Pia Sundhage , was the USA s coach from 2007-12 , after all . And if the generation she coached has largely aged out , she nevertheless understands the program , its strengths and , crucially , its weaknesses . She also knew that her team is limited going forward and had scored just twice in the group stage , barely squeaking through to the quarterfinals as the last team to qualify , with a 1-1-1 record and a minus-3 goal differential ( courtesy of a 5-1 demolishing by Brazil ) . She had learned from that loss , from trying to play with a better team . So when faced with an impossibly deep roster of American attacking talent , Sundhage set up a team that you might call cynical , or perhaps even cowardly . Because it s a coach s job to optimize her team s chances of winning . And it s a team s job to find whatever ways of winning it can to get the game won . Solo complaining about the U.S. essentially being outfoxed rings as hollow as an outsmarted kid accusing his vanquisher of cheating . The U.S. did play a courageous game with a lot of heart . Maybe even American heart , whatever that means . But Sweden won , because it had a better idea for how to win . Because in truth , the Americans played right into Sweden s strengths . Or rather , they allowed their own weaknesses to be abused . Under head coach Jill Ellis , who eventually succeeded Sundhage with Tom Sermanni s brief spell in charge bridging their terms the Americans have evolved from a direct team , sort of like Sweden is now , into a much more evolved one . They have incorporated the stupefying skill of Tobin Heath and Christen Press , and young attackers Crystal Dunn and Mallory Pugh . But even though they made strides in their attacking fluency in the year since winning the Women s World Cup , when a series of retirements by veterans and the sudden availability of time finally gave Ellis a chance to rebuild and remake , the Americans went back to pelting crosses at the Swedes . Rather than play the ball over the ground , creating overloads on the flanks and cutting the ball back to their many attacking weapons , they offered the Swedes the kind of attack the tall and sturdy women were best equipped to defend . The failure here was not Sweden s to play more adventurous soccer . It was the Americans to play blithely into the trap that had obviously been set for them . Because it was on a counterattack that Sweden went ahead in the 61st minute , when Stina Blackstenius was dispatched and scampered away . And were it not for a fluky break in the 77th minute when a ball fell fortuitously for Alex Morgan off the face of an opponent who did n t properly read a high ball headed on by Crystal Dunn the game might well have been lost in regulation . Which is to say nothing of the foul on Kosovare Asllani the Swedes claimed , but were n t awarded , earlier on that sequence , which caused them to switch off on the play . [ Photos : How U.S. superstars have changed since their first Olympics ] And lest we forget , Lotta Schelin s disallowed goal in extra time for Sweden had more merit than Carli Lloyd s disallowed goal for the U.S. a minute earlier although both probably should have stood . On balance , the Americans probably ca n t complain much about their lot . Were they the better team ? Certainly . Did they have some divine right to win it for having played the more majestic soccer ? No . In the end , the Americans failed to convert all of that possession deep in Sweden s half into goals . Lloyd had an off-day and Morgan mostly found herself crowded out in the box . Heath s many crosses seldom found a recipient . And Pugh and Dunn s runs were lost on their teammates . There were no overlaps . No useful through balls . No ideas . Soccer is a simple game . The objective is to put the ball in the net more often than the other team . If you fail to do that , you re entitled to nothing at all , no matter how negatively the other team might have achieved its result . When confronted with Solo s comments , Sundhage wasted little time on them . We won , she said . Indeed , the Swedes did . And , for their savvy game plan , deservedly so .

		"paragraph": "Microsoft ( MSFT ) has had quite enough of ransomware attacks like WannaCry and Petya . But if the company is going to get a handle on the problem , it needs the help of customers , businesses and governments around the globe . When it comes to individuals and business , Microsoft has a simple request : Stop using Windows XP . As for the world s governments , Microsoft s ask is even easier , but may be a tougher sell : If you see something vulnerable in our software , tell us instead of using it to hack our customers . Neither task will be easy , but the alternative will result in continued waves of malware attacks that steal or destroy data and leave millions of computers immobilized . You might not know this from coverage that treats each new malware attack as something that magically happens out of nowhere , but when a computer gets infected you can usually pin the problem on two preexisting conditions . One is the person using the computer , who may be uninformed , gullible or distracted enough to open the wrong file or click on the wrong link . The other is the software running on the computer , which too often is obsolete and missing the latest security patches . Microsoft and other companies ca n t do much about the first problem beyond enhancing their systems to scan links and attachments in emails for signs of malicious content , something Microsoft recently did with its Office 365 software . But that sort of reactive defense can fall short when a previously unknown threat usually called zero-day exploits , for the lack of warning experts have about them starts to spread . Every company has at least one employee who will click on anything , Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith said in a keynote Wednesday at the company s Inspire conference in Washington . That is pretty hard to protect against . But companies can and should switch to more secure software that can better resist malware that sneaks in through email . And from Microsoft s perspective , that starts with retiring the ancient Windows XP . Despite Microsoft ending support for the operating system in 2014 , the 2001-vintage OS still powered 4.86 % of Windows PCs in June , according to StatCounter another research firm , NetMarketShare , found it on 6.94 % of PCs . XP is an easy mark for malware because it allows even strange programs complete access to the system once installed . Windows XP is enormously vulnerable in ways that are impossible to change , Smith said Wednesday . He noted that XP debuted two months before the Apple ( AAPL ) iPod , then asked Is there anybody in this arena who is carrying around an iPod ? But many companies will find that swapping out XP for the far-more-secure Windows 10 is a little more complicated than moving music from an MP3 player to a smartphone . They ll first have to upgrade their own specialized internal software to run properly on Win 10 or replaced it with Win 10-compatible equivalents . Companies and individual users also need to let go of the idea that they should be able to judge each security update on its merits . Doing so could mean important security gaps could go unplugged . So sorry , but you re going to have to trust Microsoft and Apple , Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) and others to download and install security fixes automatically . But Microsoft biggest challenge lies in trying to stop governments from uncovering and hoarding Windows vulnerabilities for offensive uses a practice of the National Security Agency that went awry when attackers posted a set of the agency s hacking tools online , which was then used to build the WannaCry ransomware . In February , Smith told a security conference that nations should adopt a Digital Geneva Convention that would commit them to avoiding malware attacks on civilian targets and require the prompt disclosure of vulnerabilities to the companies that need to fix them . Smith renewed his call on Wednesday , asking for collective action by nations to reduce the malware threat . He denounced hacking attempts that target political candidates and election systems such as Russia s extensive meddling in last year s presidential election as attacking the fundamental infrastructures of our time . Smith pledged that Microsoft would have no part in any such aggressive conduct . We will not help any government attack any customer anywhere , he said . We will help defend any customer anywhere . That stance may not get Microsoft any more business out of the Kremlin , but the Redmond , Washington firm is right to put principles over profits here . Unfortunately , there are too many software firms without such hangups . More from Rob : Email Rob at rob@robpegoraro.com follow him on Twitter at @robpegoraro . ",

		"paragraph": "Online dating can often feel like an endless series of lackluster dates . But what if a dating app could increase your odds of finding somebody you actually connect with ? That s what dating app Hinge is trying to accomplish with Most Compatible , a new , free feature rolling out Wednesday that recommends one highly compatible match every day a move that comes weeks after Match Group ( MTCH ) purchased a controlling stake in the app and two months after Facebook ( FB ) announced a dating feature of its own . Here s how it works : Hinge pairs you with another user it thinks you ll likely connect with , based on algorithms that suss out your previous actions on the app and your interests . So when you log onto Hinge each day , the first match that shows up in the app s Discover section will be your so-called Most Compatible match . Skeptical ? You have every right to be , given the glut of dating apps and services promising meaningful connections . But Hinge CEO Justin McLeod claims the app is onto something here . And while Hinge does n t disclose how many relationships have resulted from the app s test run of Most Compatible in Boston and Atlanta , he says that Hinge users are eight times more likely to go on dates with their Most Compatible matches . Translation : Hinge users are more likely to give their Most Compatible matches a shot . Most Compatible is really trying to figure out what type of person you re most likely to like and also most likely to like you , McLeod told Yahoo Finance . Hinge s latest feature comes on the heels of Match Group s purchase of a 51 % controlling stake in the app in June . It also comes over a year after the company moved away from the Tinder-like method of having users simply swipe left or right on matches to serving up somewhat deeper profiles with more photos and information about each user . The redesigned Hinge became known as the anti-Tinder . That s a reference to Match Group s fastest-growing dating app , which has a reputation of enabling hookups , or more casual , short-term connections . The cash infusion from Match Group s purchase is key to helping Hinge grow beyond the U.S. , UK , Canada , Australia and India . Indeed , McLeod expects Hinge to focus on further international expansion in 2019 . They [ Match Group ] have the resources , the know-how , and they ve done it with their other apps , McLeod explained of the move . It just made a lot of sense : if we wanted to bring a throughflow of people into the U.S. and the world , they were the best partner to do that . According to the terms of the agreement , Match Group has the right to purchase all the remaining shares of Hinge within the next 11 months or so a scenario McLeod tells Yahoo Finance is highly likely to happen . Hinge does not disclose how many users it has but claims its user base has grown 400 % since October 2016 , largely driven by word-of-mouth . But just as Hinge has seen a surge in users , the virtual dating space has also grown more crowded . At Facebook s F8 conference this May , the social network announced it planned on launching a dating feature of its own later this year on an undisclosed date news that initially sent Match Group s stock tumbling nearly 22 % . The stock has partly recovered in the weeks since . For his part , McLeod contends Hinge s users wo n t take a serious hit when Facebook Dating arrives , because 90 % of Hinge s users are between the ages of 23-36 some of whom use Facebook less than ever before . It s gratifying to have one of the world s biggest technology companies enter the dating space and draw so much inspiration from Hinge , but we do n t expect our target market to use Facebook for dating , he added . They re increasingly not using Facebook at all , which is why we recently released a way to log in to Hinge without Facebook . Be that as it may , Hinge will face stiff challenges as it inevitably branches out internationally into particular markets in parts of Asia , which already have local competitors vying for people s screentime . But with Match Group s cash and potentially more engaging features like Most Compatible Hinge is better armed to compete , at least .

Shizuka Matsuki , 47 , of Plantation , Fla. , was walking her dogs on Friday in Davie , according to Officer Ronald Washington of the Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission , when the attack occurred . The FWC believes that the victim is deceased and we will continue recovery efforts on the lake with local authorities , an FWC statement read . Matsuki was walking with her dogs in Silver Lakes Rotary Nature Park when she vanished , according to police . A witness said they had seen her with her dogs earlier , but later that morning the dogs were barking near the water and she was gone . Davie Police Maj. Dale Engle said , Her dogs wo n t leave the pond . One of her dogs got bit by the gator . The police will remain on the site until her body is found . Florida developments encroach on wetlands and waterfronts . As a result , all 67 of Florida s counties have alligators , and people who live in the state can expect to see them . People are encouraged to report alligator concerns to a hotline , 866-392-4286 . While alligators are common in Florida and in the past 10 years the hotline has received 16,000 alligator complaints each year , attacks by an alligator are rare . According to the wildlife commission , there are about five unprovoked bites per year . Common advice from the wildlife commission is to keep pets away from edges of water and not swim with your dog , as they attract alligators . To avoid confrontation with an alligator , swim only in posted safe swimming areas during daylight hours . The FWC added , This tragedy is heartbreaking for everyone involved , and our sincere condolences go out to the family and friends of the victim at this time .

		"paragraph": "Warning : This recap contains spoilers for Episode 6 of The Bachelor . Boy , this to be continued / rose ceremony at the beginning of the show stuff is getting old . Enough okay , Team Bachelor ? Thanks . This week s already in progress episode begins with the ladies at the hotel , waiting for the Suitcase Ninja to come and fetch the eliminated woman s bags . And when the PA with the two-toned hair removes Taylor s suitcase , the women are surprised but not all that upset . ( Corinne s coming back ! cries Josephine happily . ) It must be a shocker for her , notes Jaimi . Which is a perfect segue to … Can we talk ? Taylor asks the flustered Bachelor , who of course has no option but to say , Um … sure . Once outside , Taylor says everything she should have said during the swamp date namely that Corinne grossly misrepresented their conversation and that Nick needs to open his eyeballs . I m not the only one saying this about Corinne , notes Taylor . Vanessa literally told you that she would give you back your rose if this is what you were looking for . Nick , who looks genuinely scared , gives Taylor the old I hear what you re saying , and I believe that you believe it s important response ( long live Bobby Hill ) , and then sends Taylor on her way . Related : Chris Harrison Blogs ‘ The Bachelor Episode 6 And with that , he and Corinne go back to making out . I do see a lot of potential in Corinne , says the Bachelor . And that s very much worth exploring . I think we all know what Nick means by exploring : Corinne s going to make it to the overnight dates , is n t she ? Sure . But maybe use one of those lives to tend to that hair , okay ? Rose ceremony time ! And honestly , ladies , why are you so surprised that there s no cocktail party ? Time s a wastin ! Robot roll call : Kristina , Raven , Vanessa , Danielle L. , Jasmine , and Whitney ( WHO ? ) will join Corinne , Danielle M. , and Rachel in the next round . Alas , this means we ll be saying goodbye to Alexis the aspiring dolphin trainer and Nic Cage phobic at least until Bachelor in Paradise . We must also bid farewell to Jaimi ( did n t love the dress , but definitely there for that purple lipstick and matching nail color ) and Josephine . Adios , chicas . And we re off to St. Thomas ! And you know what that means : Nick gets to break out yet another tank top ! The ladies helpfully remind us that there are still three women out of the remaining nine who have n t had one-on-one dates yet : Jasmine , Kristina and Whitney ( who ? ) . So when Nick arrives via puddle-jumper , which woman will he whisk away for a romantic island adventure ? , Kristina ! You re up . ( Sorry , Jasmine . ) I kind of had a feeling , says Kristina , when Nick asks if she expected to get the one-on-one date . Yes , gurl you own your fabulousness ! The duo jets off to the Annaberg Ruins , where they sip beer and enjoy a little get-to-know-you chat . We learn that Kristina has 9 siblings 8 from her adoptive family and one sister who still lives in Russia . I m gon na work really hard to knock down these walls that Kristina has up , notes Nick , who adds that he has very strong feelings for the Russian beauty . Meanwhile , back at the hotel , Team Bachelor trolls Corinne by sending a nice old lady named Lorna in , ostensibly to take care of all the women but we only see her tending to Corinne . Honestly , I hope production gave her a huge tip . At dinner , we finally get to hear more about Kristina s backstory and it s a doozy . Let s listen in : She goes on to say that she was in an orphanage within weeks , and that her mom who has since passed away never came to visit her at the orphanage . After seven or eight years , Kristina was adopted by an American family a happy thing , yes , but she was heartbroken to say goodbye to the kids she grew up with at the orphanage . Leaving all of them behind , knowing I wo n t ever see them again … I think at the time that s why it was so hard . Oh man , I need a minute here . Nick does , too . Of course Kristina gets the date rose AS WELL SHE SHOULD . ( And by the way , Team Bachelor , if you need a candidate for the next Bachelorette , keep this formidable woman in mind , okay ? ) Group date time ! Rachel , Raven , Vanessa , Corinne , Danielle M. and Jasmine meet Nick at the pier for a catamaran ride to Abi Beach . ( This means , by the way , that Whitney ( WHO ? ) and Danielle L. have inexplicably been assigned to a two-on-one date , but more on that later . ) After a few island cocktails , Nick the drunk little baby dinosaur is clearly feeling no pain . The ladies , however , are pretty deep in their feelings . Jasmine remains bummed that she has yet to get any real quality time with Nick , and it s having a less-than-stellar effect on her judgment . Meanwhile , Danielle , Rachel , and Vanessa have slowly come to the realization that competing for a man on TV is both undignified and an inefficient way to find a mate . The fact that I have to go through these next few weeks having to deal with all the competition and all the gossip and all the talk and the other one-on-ones it s so f *** ing annoying , says Vanessa tearfully . And now Danielle s crying , too ! I guess the combination of hot sun , deep-seated insecurities , and a s ** t-ton of alcohol does not a great group date make . It s pretty much a disaster , admits Nick . It almost feels like a wasted day . And so , our Bachelor heads into the evening cocktail party fully resolved to pick up the pieces from the craptastic beach party . He apologizes to the ladies and promises that he ll be giving each of them some quality time over the course of the evening . Well strap in , pal , because it looks like all the women want to use their alone time to complain about how awful the day was . Rachel even goes so far to warn Nick that she was on the verge of leaving the show . As for Jasmine , she s completely spinning out ranting to the other women about how she wants to punch Nick in the face for not giving her the validation she so deserves . How patient can you f *** in be ? she snaps . I m gon na tell him , straight to his face : ‘ Do n t you DARE overlook me ! ' Sure , that ll end well . When the Bachelor finally pulls Jasmine aside for a chat , she launches right in with her complaints . I like you a lot . I really do , she tells Nick . But in a way it s like , I just feel like maybe I m being overlooked … I m here , do you not see me ? She goes from defiant to earnest to weepy to weird , and by the time she playfully chokes the Bachelor , you can tell he s ready to end this non-relationship post haste . I did n t have the best conversation with Jasmine , notes Nick , in the understatement of the night . In fact , it was actually a bit awkward . So he gently informs Jasmine that he s not feeling it , adding , It might be time to say goodbye . You think ? Farewell , Jasmine . We ll probably see you in Paradise but for your sake , I hope not . The next day , it s time for the surprise two-on-one date . Like all the viewers , both Danielle L. and Whitney ( who ? ) want to know why they ve been chosen for this dubious honor . Whitney and I do n t have any animosity between us , notes Danielle sadly . But when the time comes , neither Danielle nor Whitney asks Nick to explain himself ( as far as we know ) . It s also hard to glean any clues from the Bachelor : Nick tells Whitney that she s a calming person for him to be around , while Danielle tells him that she wants to be the last person at the end of this . Hearing this , Nick now seems to have the clarity he was seeking . He excuses himself from Danielle and heads over to the beach bed where Whitney is reclining alone . You can guess what happens next . Whitney makes a half-hearted attempt to change his mind You think that Danielle L. is ready for a relationship ? but Nick stands firm . He gives Whitney a hug goodbye before exiting the situation with Danielle the only way he knows how : via helicopter . Say it with me one last time , rose lovers : Not to say that Danielle L. has officially won , however . Over dinner , Nick is clearly ambivalent and a little distant as he half-heartedly reminisces with her about their one-on-one date . It does seem like forever ago , does n t it ? he mumbles tellingly . It seems our Bachelor is looking for a raw love one where we love everything about each other , the good and the bad but to be honest , Danielle L. seems more flash-frozen than raw . And once she professes that she s falling in love with Nick , he knows what he has to do . A tearful Danielle wonders if she got the boot because she was n t perfect , which is a sad but expected sentiment from a reality TV dating show contestant . A tearful Nick , meanwhile , is starting to shame spiral about his chances of finding love , a concern he feels he should communicate to the women immediately . I really want this to work out , says Nick between sniffles . But I want it to be real and I want it to be right . And , you know , right now I just feel , like , terrified that it s not gon na happen . Team Bachelor wants us to believe that Nick ended this little speech with So , I do n t know if I can keep doing this , but at this point I think we can all recognize a Frankenstein-ed soundbite when we hear one . Even so , Nick s tearful visit rocks the ladies to their core . They wipe away tears and wonder aloud if their 15 minutes of fame I mean , chance to find love is about to come to an abrupt end . Unlikely , but we ll have to wait until next week to find out how Nick decides to proceed as well as whether he ll take Corinne up on her platinum vagine offer . In the meantime , rose lovers , I want to hear from you . Do you think Nick actually sees a future with any of these women ? Did you ever expect Nick to cry so much ? And is there anything more cruel than giving someone gross chocolate ? Post your thoughts now ! And be sure to check out Chris Harrison s exclusive behind-the-scenes blog here .

( AP ) The New York Giants are trading star defensive tackle Damon \" Snacks \" Harrison to the Detroit Lions , a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press . The Giants will receive a fifth-round draft pick in 2019 for the stalwart in the middle of the defensive line , according to the person , who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity Wednesday because the deal has not been announced . \" I 'm not going to comment on any situation that is not official or not complete , \" Detroit coach Matt Patricia said Wednesday . \" There 's a process that is involved in all this . We have spoken to the Giants . That is true . \" ESPN was the first to report the trade , which comes less than a week before the league 's trading deadline at 4 p.m. Tuesday .

		"paragraph": "It 's no secret that the average American is ill prepared , financially speaking , for retirement . On the one hand , that should n't be too surprising : the very idea of retirement is almost brand new to humans . On the other hand , it does n't change the fact that as we 're living longer lives , we 'll need to provide for ourselves for decades after exiting the workforce . Image source : Getty Images . While current retirees are well aware of how important Social Security is in their finances , many younger workers do n't have a firm grasp on just how important the program is . They look at the average monthly benefit of about $ 1,350 and think , \" That 's a pittance . \" When put in perspective of most Americans ' retirement income , however , it is enormously important . And I 've got the graph to prove it . We 'll get to that graph in a second , but first we need to calibrate expectations for retirement . One of the biggest misconceptions out there is that your spending will go up after you claim Social Security . While every household will have its own unique experience , on the whole , this simply is n't true . For proof , let 's look at the 2016 Consumer Expenditure Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics . Below , I 've picked out the five largest categories in household spending and how they change in the 20 years leading to -- and including -- retirement . Data source : Bureau of Labor Statistics . As you can see , while healthcare costs do , in fact , increase , those increases are dwarfed by falls in spending on all other major categories . Think about it for a minute and it all makes sense : Some might retort that these spending reductions are forced because of a lack of income and not the result of choice . Those people might be right . But my response would be simple : As long as basic needs are being met , who cares ? We know that hedonic adaptation works both ways -- meaning that as long as basic needs are met , we can adjust to fewer physical comforts in our life quickly . And study after study shows that levels of contentment spike -- and stay high -- once people enter retirement . The main reason I highlight this is to put the amount that Social Security provides in perspective . In financial planning circles , there 's an all-important tool called the 4 % rule . In the most basic sense , it states that whatever your nest egg is , you can take out 4 % of it in year one and take out the same amount every year thereafter -- adjusting for inflation -- without having to worry about running out of money . According to TransAmerica , the median baby boomer has retirement assets -- including IRAs , 401 ( k ) s , and the like -- of $ 164,000 . Using the 4 % rule , this means that the nest egg can be safely relied upon for $ 6,560 per year in retirement , or about $ 550 per month . This rule will come in handy below when we examine the massive importance of Social Security . According to New Retirement 's annual report , the typical pension can be worth as little as $ 9,262 for private employees and as much as $ 22,172 for retirees from the government . A January 2018 report from the Pension Rights Center estimates that 12.9 % and 10.4 % of all workers currently have privately funded or government pensions , respectively . Obviously , if you are one of the few who gets this income , you can count yourself lucky . But if we look at the pension 's effect on American retirement as a whole -- which factors in the reality that more than 75 % of current workers will not receive pension income -- the average annual pension income comes out to just $ 3,500 per year . Using the 4 % rule , this is equivalent to a nest egg of about $ 87,500 . In June 2018 ( the most recent month with data available ) , the typical retired worker received a monthly Social Security benefit of $ 1,413 . The typical spousal benefit clocked in at $ 737 per month . When we do the math for the blend between retired worker ( 43 million recipients ) and spousal ( 2.4 million recipients ) , the typical household of retirees gets monthly Social Security benefits of about $ 2,009 . Again , it 's easy to look at that $ 2,000 and think , \" That 's really not much . \" But we need to remember what we 've covered above : you wo n't need nearly as much in retirement , and -- if you 're like the median American household -- you wo n't get more money from any other source . To really drive the point home , let 's consider that $ 2,009 per month rounds to $ 24,108 per year . That 's almost two-thirds of what the average retired household spends in a year . But here 's the really important part -- if we viewed this benefit as if it were a nest egg , using the 4 % rule , it would come out to almost $ 603,000 . Let 's put that in perspective : Calculations by author . Perhaps , then , it 's not surprising that two of every three retirees count of Social Security for most of their income . More to the point , the program provides over 90 % of income for one of every three retirees . Social Security advocates also point out that if the program disappeared tomorrow , the poverty rate for this demographic would jump from 10 % today to as high as 45 % . Keep in mind , there are definitely key pieces missing . Many retirees continue to do part-time work , and others can count on things like rental real estate for income . And , as I stated above , if you actually do get a pension , it has a much bigger effect . But if we back up to look at the situation from a societal level , this chart proves something beyond a shadow of a doubt : Social Security is massively important , and while it may not be enough for many retirees to live on alone , most would be devastated if it disappeared overnight . That 's important for all of us to remember as changes are debated to make the program sustainable moving forward . Your future retirement will no doubt be affected .

		"paragraph": "Millions of Fornite gamers may have allowed hackers to download malicious apps onto their phones without ever realising . A serious flaw in the first Fortnite installer - an app that helps users download the game on their Android phones - allowed any app on a user s phone to silently install other apps . The discovery was made by Google s security team after Fornite maker , Epic Games , decided to release its own installer as a way to bypass the Google Play Store . The Google Play Store is the app store for Android phones , used on smartphone models from Samsung , Sony and Huawei . It is considered a more secure way to download apps from the internet , which could contain viruses or malware . But Fortnite , the widely popular cartoon-like online game where players compete in a \" battle royale \" , is n t featured . Instead , Epic Games decided to skip using the Google Play store to distribute Fornite so that it could avoid paying Google a 30pc cut of its game s revenue . Google 's security team first disclosed the vulnerability privately to Epic Games on August 15 . Epic Games said it fixed the issue within hours of being informed . Google found that the installer was vulnerable to what is known as a \" man-in-the-disk \" attack . Fortnite downloads an APK , which is the package for Android apps , stores it locally and then launches it . The installer , however , only checked that the name of the APK was right . If a file wascalled com.epicgames.fortnite , it would launch it , regardless of whether it was fake or malicious . This means hackers could intercept the request to download Fornite and download something else instead , such as spyware . Ahead of its release on Android , cyber security company Sophos warned the decision to bypass the Google Play store could backfire . \" [ It ] risks undermining one of the simplest , most useful and easiest to remember pieces of security advice we can offer : stick to Google Play , it said . NCC chief technology officer Ollie Whitehouse told the Telegraph : \" It is not what we would recommend . There is a lot of effort put into securing these stores , and this is setting a precedent .

Identified only as Charlotte , the professional flier took to Twitter to call out two male passengers for remarks they made on a flight over the weekend . Though Charlotte said she was n t offended or disheartened by their sexist reactions to a woman being at the controls , she did say she was saddened by the fact that this is the attitude some still have , and think it is OK to make these comments to women . She shared that the men in question joked about her ability to fly the plane , trotting out stereotypes about female drivers . Charlotte brushed off the comments until another female crew member raised the issue . Upon further reflection , she realized that comments like these can hurt women and discourage them from pursuing careers in aviation . It is this attitude that puts women off and another barrier stopping them from going into male-dominated careers , Charlotte added in a follow-up tweet . It should n t even be a thing !!! I am a pilot , he is a pilot . See , there is no difference . I did n t get where I am today by listening to these kinds of comments , she continued . Her Twitter thread , which now has more than 74,000 likes , drew supportive responses . Some commenters shared their own experiences with workplace sexism , especially in traditionally male-dominated industries . Her tweets came just over a month after Southwest captain and Navy veteran Tammie Jo Shults was praised for safely landing Flight 1380 after an engine blew mid-flight . Shults was one of the first women to fly a fighter jet .

		"paragraph": "One of the biggest plays in a game full of big plays in last night s Red Sox-Astros game was the call of fan interference that took a home run away from Jose Altuve . Well , actually , it did n t technically take a home run away , because right field umpire Joe West never called it a home run to begin with . He called it , sorta , tentatively , fan interference and it was thrown in the lap of replay officials . For my part and , it seems to me , for the part of most folks watching the game West blew the call . The fan in question did not reach out onto the field of play Mookie Betts ‘ glove entered the stands and the rules clearly state that no interference is called if a spectator comes in contact with a batted or thrown ball without reaching onto the field of play . It s only if he or she reaches out onto the field . If the ball is in the stands , all s fair in love and souvenir-snagging . After the game , West was interviewed about the call . Here is how he explained it . Q . What did you see that prompted the initial call of fan interference ? JOE WEST : Well , when he jumped up to reach for the ball , the spectator reached out of the stands and hit him over the playing field and closed his glove . Q . So the ball had not yet crossed the railing ? JOE WEST : No . Q. And Betts glove had not yet crossed the railing , do you believe ? JOE WEST : No . Q. Okay . Did the fan JOE WEST : Here s the whole play , here s the whole play . He hit the ball to right field . He jumped up to try to make a catch . The fan interfered with him over the playing field . That s why I called spectator interference . Q . So it s a clear call in your mind ? JOE WEST : Yes . Q. Were there already was there a single call that you saw , that the replay officials saw on replay that confirmed JOE WEST : I do n t know what he saw . He just the replay official said I was right . Q. Okay . JOE WEST : That s all . He said I have nothing that can change it . That last bit is not entirely true , by the way . They did n t say , specifically , that West was right . Rather , they could not find sufficient evidence to overturn West , so the call stood . Which is an important distinction : if the ruling was that West was definitively correct , the ruling would ve been that West s call was confirmed . That is not what they said . They said the call stands , which meant that they did n t have enough evidence to overturn West . That s a different issue in its entirety , by the way : the deference given to the field umpires and the high burden replay officials have to overturn them . Here , I suspect it was a matter of them not having sufficient camera angles establishing that the fan had not reached onto the field . I think that s nuts given what even the primary view and some basic common sense showed Betts did not run to the wall and then jump straight up , failing to break the plane into the stands but the current replay system places a high burden on replay guys overruling the field umpires . That whole setup is dumb . This is not the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and guys like Joe West should not be treated like District Court judges to whom deference should always be granted . Replay officials have better views almost every single time and they should be able to simply substitute their judgment rather than meet some high burden aimed , I suspect , at making field umpires feel like they re not losing power now that baseball takes a 21st century approach to officiating rather than a 19th century approach . Unfortunately for the Astros , that is not how the replay rule works . Unfortunately for the Astros , Joe West s judgment was to be deferred to . Unfortunately for the Astros , West blew that call and , unfortunately for the Astros , it cost them a two-run homer that could ve changed the outcome of this game . Follow @craigcalcaterra",

		"paragraph": "Warning : This interview for the The Other Side episode of The Walking Dead contains spoilers . Rosita and Sasha fought , made up ( sorta ) , bonded ( sorta ) , and declared they had each other s backs . But now they re separated once again , this time by Sasha s attempt to spare her new friend s life during their suicide mission to kill Negan inside the Saviors Sanctuary compound . At the end of The Other Side and with just two episodes remaining in Season 7 Sasha s inside the Sanctuary , Rosita s outside staring at a man who may be friend ( Daryl ) or foe ( Dwight ) , and neither is sure what the deal is with Eugene , who refused their help to escape and voluntarily returned to his Sanctuary home . Christian Serratos , who plays Rosita , talked to Yahoo TV about her character s big Thelma & Louise-ish adventure with Sasha , including what prompted her to go to her romantic rival for help , how she felt about seeing the necklace she made for Abraham on Sasha , why Rosita spilled such personal details to Sasha , and what she thinks about the bow-carrying mystery man who we think may be the key to the new strategy she says Rosita will adopt for the rest of the season . Congratulations . Those were great scenes between you and Sonequa Martin-Green . Yeah , thanks . I was really excited and nervous about it . What made you nervous ? Because we were seeing a little bit more of who [ Rosita ] was . We were getting a little bit of her backstory , which we had n t before , so it was something that I wanted to do justice to . I wanted to work hard and make sure I was putting in all the elements that I felt needed to be there , that the fans wanted there . That scene in the warehouse is my favorite of the episode , and I think it may be the best Rosita scene ever . We really get to see her be vulnerable , which is very rare . Yeah , and I really respect that about Rosita . No matter what , even when we do see her be vulnerable , that wall … she somehow gets it back up , but I think that s really cool . She s got that really tough exterior . I think that s probably a lot of who she was before the apocalypse as well , and it was just intensified when the world came crumbling down . But it was really cool to be a little more vulnerable . She s been so angry and so focused on revenge for most of the season , more than anyone except maybe Daryl . Has that been tough to play , being in that mindset all season ? It has been tough , but it s also been really fun , and I know that makes me sound a little bit like a sociopath , but I had so much fun with the struggle . This work can be a struggle sometimes . It can be really hard to get to the places that you need to get to to show an honest performance , you know what I mean ? It could so often be surface , and that s what I think all actors try to avoid , any sort of emotion being just surface , because you re not going to affect another individual that way . It has to be real to you in that moment , which can also be a little destructive . I mean , after that first episode [ of Season 7 ] … all of us gave 150 percent , and it s hard to turn off . When you go home , you re still a little bit traumatized . We were all traumatized from that episode . It took a lot longer than just the end of the workday . There are a few 16-hour days in an episode , and we shoot episodes very quickly , quicker than I think most shows right now . We do our own stunts . We re running . In Atlanta , it s , like , 112 degrees , and we re running on freeways and reversing cars and jumping over fences . We want to do these things . We re all crazy kids who want to play pretend and do all these fun things , but then you realize after one or two takes how grueling it is . So we re very grateful for the crew and the production that we have to keep us as safe as they keep us and as healthy as they can , and we re also very grateful for people like stunt drivers , because there s some s *** that we have to [ sit out ] . Did you do any of the great stunt where Rosita hot-wires the car and maneuvers it out of the fenced yard in reverse ? I did n t do any of the driving . We were in the car . It was a rig . It was dangerous then . But there s also things that , as crazy as we all are … we all want to shoot the guns and blow up buildings and things like that , but they re not going to let us hurt ourselves , so they bring in the real professionals when they have to . What does it take for Rosita to go to the hilltop and ask Sasha for help ? That s really opening herself up given everything that has happened . Oh , yeah . She does n t have to swallow her pride , but she knows that the only person maybe as motivated as she is right now is the person who also lost a love of hers . [ Sasha ] lost her man . And while , yes , that was the man we saw Rosita with , the bond that she and Abraham had was different , and it was larger for many different reasons . So I think Rosita had confidence that Sasha cared enough about Abraham to want to go with her . Does she believe she needs Sasha s help ? I do n t know that that s playing any part right now . I think we ve seen how headstrong Rosita can be about a mission . That was how she was introduced to the show , [ as part of ] a mission to get Eugene to Washington . So I think right now she s thinking of the mission more than anything , and I think she knows that Sasha could be an asset . Rosita spots the necklace she made for Abraham , the one Sasha is now wearing . It obviously bothers her . But ultimately does the fact that Sasha is wearing it also signal to her that yes , Sasha loved Abraham too , and does that help soften her toward Sasha eventually ? No , I think Rosita knew Sasha had true love for Abraham way before then . I think , if anything , the necklace just pissed her off , because it s weird that what she is wearing is not an indication of Abraham it s really an indication of Rosita s love for Abraham . So it s very weird that she s wearing it , and even stranger that she keeps it on after [ Rosita tells her she made it ] , but that s none of [ Rosita s ] business , I guess . Did Sasha know that s where the necklace came from before Rosita said it ? Or did she keep it because she knew it was Abraham s ? I think she keeps it because she knows it s Abraham s , but the second that Rosita tells her , Do you like it ? I made it , that s when it should have come off . But I think that s because and we ll never know , because we re not in an apocalypse , but she s keeping it on because that s all she has left of him . And that just shows the love that she had for Abraham , that despite the fact that Rosita made it , she s still willing to keep it near and dear to her heart because she loved him . One of the other great scenes between Rosita and Sasha is the exchange about the best approach for killing Negan . Should it be to go after him from the outside or from the inside ? They re both right potentially both plans have pluses and minuses . They want the same things , they re both capable . It s not a surprise that Abraham liked them both , because the bottom line is that they are similar : very tough , capable women who are survivors , and who are very stubborn . That is true , and we ve seen the parallels with these two characters for a long time , all of us as a cast . So it definitely was n t surprising at all that he was seeking a relationship with [ Sasha ] . I love these two characters , because they are so different , they have different ways of doing things . And we ve seen them with their reaction to Abraham s death : Rosita does not handle it well , and she gets very hard , way harder than we ve seen her be , and Sasha tried to find a common thing . She tries to relate to Rosita , is hoping that she is going to open up more , but instead , it made her more introverted . I think when Sasha sees Rosita finally open up , I think that s something she s maybe been wanting to happen for a while . What is the thing that ultimately makes Rosita soften toward Sasha when they re together in the factory , makes her tell her about her past ? She said she s never told anyone those things about herself . So why Sasha , and why now ? I think it s a lot of things . I think a lot of it is her knowing that this is potentially a suicide mission for herself and this might be the only time she gets to say it out loud . These might be her final words . But I think she also knows that Sasha has been making an effort with her , so , in Rosita terms , I think she s throwing her a bone . What is Rosita thinking when Eugene refuses her and Sasha s help to escape ? Is she assuming he s a traitor ? Is she assuming he s a coward ? Or does she think that maybe he s trying to protect her and Sasha to get them to go away and save themselves ? I think she just thinks he s an idiot , which is something that she thinks quite often of him , but he can be an idiot . He s also the smartest idiot in the world . We ve seen what he s capable of , his intelligence , his desire to stay alive and his drive to stay alive , and the fact that he s not as useless as people thought in the very beginning . That thought went away very quickly when he started saving people s lives . At this point , I do n t think she puts anything past him . I do n t know if she knows that this is all for survival . I do n t know if she knows that he s gone forever , but it s going to be interesting to see how she reacts when she finds out exactly which way this is going to go with him . She and Sasha tell each other they have their backs when they re about to go on this mission , and they both do , although I think Sasha meant that in a way that Rosita did n t expect . Sasha is trying to save Rosita s life . She s telling her it s not her time when she goes through that fence , which , as you just said , is likely a suicide mission . We see Rosita very angry she s crying . Is she sad that she thinks Sasha has gone on this suicide mission ? Is she also angry that Sasha duped her and is leaving her out of the revenge plan ? I think it s a little bit of anger . I think it s frustration . I think she needed to see that through , and she s being robbed of it . But I think bigger than that , it s guilt . That s what I think . And what s great is that people can interpret it in any way they want … but I feel , as a fan and then as an individual , I think she s feeling guilty because [ Sasha ] is essentially saving her life , and she s wasted a lot of time [ being angry ] . That s what I think she s thinking . Being angry at Sasha ? Maybe , yeah . At the end , she sees someone with a bow standing nearby . That changes her immediate reaction . Yeah , but I do n t know if we know exactly what she s seeing , and I think that s on purpose . I think there s a little hesitation , because it could be somebody that she s very familiar with . But why do n t we know for sure ? I do n t think she can see who it is . I think the audience maybe knows who it is … I think us watching it , we see something that she does n t . She s running away , and then she stops . We do n t know for sure who she sees someone with a bow , could be Daryl , who had just asked Jesus where she was , could maybe be Dwight , because Eugene had just ordered the Saviors to look for walkers but is it safe to assume she is n t going to just leave Sasha there in the Sanctuary without making some attempt to help her and save her ? Rosita never wants to give up or to accept a failure or loss , so I think there s definitely going to be action . I definitely think there s going to be a new strategy now . That s what we re going to see next . What else can you say about the final two episodes of the season ? Every year I feel like we try to outdo ourselves , we try to raise the bar , we try to give the audience more of a roller-coaster ride , more colors , more feelings . And so far , I think we ve succeeded . So I feel like more than ever , this is going to be a bigger , badder , more explosive season finale . I think whatever happens , whether we win or lose or people die , I think there is always a renewed life to this show , and it s only going to be that much more fascinating for the next season . ‘ The Walking Dead airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on AMC .

		"paragraph": "Canadian marijuana Goliath Aurora Cannabis ( NYSE : ACB ) filed to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) earlier this month , and yesterday its shares began trading on the exchange under its new symbol , ACB . The move to the NYSE opens the door for investors who previously avoided buying because they did n't want to buy -- or were prohibited from buying ! -- Aurora Cannabis shares in the over-the-counter market or on the Toronto Stock Exchange . Here 's why the company 's move to the NYSE is important and what you should know about this cannabis company before investing in it . IMAGE SOURCE : GETTY IMAGES . Most of the $ 150 billion that changes hands every year in the marijuana market occurs on the illicit black market , but increasingly , legalization is bringing these transactions out of the shadows and onto regulated marketplaces . In the U.S. , 30 states have passed laws allowing medical marijuana 's use , and nine states , including California , have passed laws establishing recreational marketplaces . But despite growing momentum in the U.S. , marijuana remains illegal on a federal level , and that 's unlikely to change anytime soon . The story 's different in Canada . A nationwide medical marijuana market has been thriving since rule changes in 2014 cleared the way to regulating growers and retailers , and this month Canada became the first of the G7 countries to legalize marijuana 's recreational use nationwide . Although it remains to be seen how large Canada 's marijuana market will be , estimates suggest that the biggest cannabis companies in Canada could be about to profit from billions of dollars in additional sales . According to Statista , medical marijuana sales in Canada were roughly 600 million Canadian dollars in 2017 , and according to Deloitte , recreational marijuana sales in Canada next year could eclipse CA$ 4 billion . Investors interested in marijuana stocks have been hamstrung because marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance in the U.S . The scheduling limits access to banking services and prevents companies from conducting business across state lines . As a result , the U.S. market is highly fragmented , and most U.S. marijuana companies trade on the over-the-counter market , a thinly regulated market that has exposed investors to fraud in the past . Instead of risking it on over-the-counter stocks , investors have been forced to look north of the border to Canada , where companies like Aurora Cannabis trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange . Buying and selling stocks outside the U.S. , however , can be more expensive than trading stocks on the U.S. market , and many professional investors , including mutual funds , are governed by mandates that prevent them from owning companies that trade on foreign exchanges . The inability for Canadian cannabis companies to tap these U.S. investors for funding was n't a major problem in the past . However , it 's become more important because the recreational market opportunity is more capital-intensive than the medical marijuana market opportunity . In order to satisfy demand caused by a shift to a regulated market from the black market , cannabis companies are investing significantly to boost marijuana production capacity , develop distribution , and establish a brick-and-mortar and an online retail presence . These projects have required Aurora Cannabis to issue more shares to raise money to orchestrate M&A deals . It 's also reportedly prompted conversations with large , established consumer products companies , including Coca-Cola , about deals that could provide it with expertise and money . Now that Aurora Cannabis is trading on the NYSE , the company should have an even greater ability to raise money from stock offerings . It may also make it easier to negotiate with U.S. consumer products companies that may have worried in the past that a deal could jeopardize their own U.S. listing . IMAGE SOURCE : GETTY IMAGES . Aurora Cannabis does n't appear willing to enter the U.S. market until marijuana prohibition ends federally , so its listing on the NYSE still does n't give U.S. investors exposure to markets in individual states , such as California , that have passed pro-pot laws . Nevertheless , there 's plenty of opportunity for growth in Canada and elsewhere , including Germany . The Canadian recreational market is limited to dried flower and cannabis oils for now , but edibles , vapes , and certain concentrates could become available there as early as next year . Those products are expected to drive significant interest among new users , thus expanding the addressable market . As more products become available , beer , wine , and spirits giant Constellation Brands predicts Canada 's retail marijuana market could be worth $ 11 billion in 15 years . If so , then Aurora Cannabis could be perfectly positioned . Its acquisition of MedReleaf earlier this year gives it CA$ 33 million in trailing pro forma revenue , making it the top-selling Canadian cannabis company . The company 's acquisitions also expanded it even more beyond dried flower to extracts , which command better profit margins . Meeting Canada 's demand will require increasingly more state-of-the-art production space , and Aurora Cannabis is arguably the leader there , too . It 's investing CA$ 150 million in next-generation greenhouses , and spending on its \" Sky \" class facilities is expected to increase its production capacity to 570,000 kilograms , up from about 108,000 kilograms of funded capacity one year ago . Its new production facilities are already starting to improve gross margin because automation is reducing labor costs , which are the biggest expense that 's associated with operating greenhouses . Last quarter , Aurora Cannabis ' gross margin improved 7 % to 74 % , and over time Aurora Cannabis is targeting production costs at its Sky class facilities below $ 1 per gram . If it hits that target , it 'll be one of the lowest-cost producers in Canada . Having said that , valuing this company is n't easy . It 's still losing money on an operational basis and there 's no telling when that will stop . Therefore , it 's essentially useless to compare its price-to-earnings ratio to other major participants , most of whom are also losing money because of their spending on expansion projects . Other valuation metrics , including price-to-sales ratios and price-to-book ratios , are n't much use , either . Price-to-sales ratios are based on trailing revenue that does n't reflect the expected jump in sales next year because of legalization . Similarly , price-to-book ratios , which show how much investors are paying for each dollar of a company 's breakup value , may fail to appreciate how much these companies could be worth in the future because of widespread legalization . Personally , I think its addressable market is big enough to justify its current market cap , but it could be years before this company matures . Therefore , only aggressive investors who can withstand the fits and starts likely to occur in this industry over the next decade should consider buying Aurora Cannabis .

		"paragraph": "Just one month after a grieving orca mother carried her dead calf for weeks through the waters around San Juan Island , Washington , tragedy has struck another member of the Southern Resident population s Jpod . Following Tahlequah s unprecedented mourning display , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) continued to keep close tabs on the whale , also know as J35 . Around the same time , NOAA also started closely monitoring another pod member , 3-year-old juvenile orca Scarlet , or J50 . The young whale caught the scientists attention because she appeared weak and emaciated . With the Southern Resident orca population critically endangered , every member is important for the continuation of the group , especially younger whales who could possibly mate in the future . NOAA has been monitoring the whale throughout August and September , providing regular updates on its website . At first the updates seemed promising J50 was observed eating and swimming strongly throughout August , and was also given antibiotics via a dart to treat a potential parasite . RELATED VIDEO : Killer Whale Finally Lets Go of Her Dead Calf After Carrying it For 17 Days Unfortunately , in September the young orca began take a turn for the worse . She was observed lagging behind her family group and looked thinner than ever . Worried that something would happen to the whale without intervention , NOAA started working with Fisheries and Oceans Canada to figure out a way to help the whale and keep her a part of the population . On Sept. 13 , NOAA announced that J50 had not been seen for several days even with favorable conditions and sightings of her pod and family group , including J16 , her mother . According to NBC News , scientists have declared J50 dead . Federal authorities will continue to look for the whale in hopes the conclusion is wrong . This is another tragic blow for the Southern Resident population , which has not reproduced a healthy whale in three years . There are now only 72 whales left in the group . These orca whales have been negatively effected by a drop in the salmon population , boat noise and pollution .",

		"paragraph": "No , you did n t hear a rumor : After nearly 30 years , the original Bananarama lineup is back , and they re going on tour for the first time ever . We ve had such an extraordinary experience of life together , in our formative years , but we never got to celebrate it , founding member Siobhan Fahey , who left the British girl group in 1988 , tells Yahoo Music . We created something that was great which really I think is only just getting its recognition now . Fahey is correct . Sure , casual fans will no doubt cheer for slick dance smashes like Love in the First Degree and the Hi-NRG Shocking Blue remake Venus on Bananarama s upcoming reunion tour ( which kicks off Nov. 12 in Glasgow and reaches North America in February 2018 ) . But the diehards know that Bananarama ( who are actually in The Guinness Book of World Records as the all-female group with the most worldwide chart hits ) formed out of the ashes of the punk and New Romantic scenes and that the trio contributed an important chapter to the history of post-punk . Yeah , it s frustrating , sighs Fahey about misconceptions that Bananarama were a manufactured record label creation la the Spice Girls , rather than an organic group like any of their 80s new wave peers . ( Fahey s bandmates , Sara Dallin and Keren Woodward , were childhood friends Dallin and Fahey met as students at the London College of Fashion . ) I mean , for our first few rehearsals , I was on guitar , Sara was on bass , and Keren was on drums . … I think the fact that because we were a vocal group and we were female , and back then women were just not taken seriously at all , it was assumed that we were somebody s puppets . Which is completely ridiculous . Nobody ever told us what to do . No one really believed in us ! We kept coming up with good ideas , good new tunes and records that the public liked , but I think the media kind of dismissed us at the time . Bananarama s punk-rock past dates back to their connection with the Sex Pistols , whose drummer Paul Cook helped record their debut single , the lo-fi disco/ska romp Aie a Mwana . ( Cook also had a co-production credit on their debut album , Deep Sea Skiving . ) Fahey recalls squatting in Cook and Pistols guitarist Steve Jones s squalid rehearsal space in those Dickensian early days : Sara and Keren were made homeless , and [ Cook ] let them live in the studio until they found somewhere to live . And then I was made homeless , so I moved in with them . There was an outside toilet , one cold water tap , some mattresses on the attic floor , and carrier bags to catch the rain . We were there until we got rehoused by the council . That s where we formed the band . But those were happy days , you know , Fahey says fondly . Somebody sent me some [ old ] photos [ recently ] , which was such a joy for me to see . We used to have netball matches with friends in other bands , or we d go out dancing every night in the underground club scene where everybody was forming bands , many of whom went on to be in that big first wave of pop on MTV : Wham ! , Sade , Spandau Ballet , us . We all used to hang out at the same places . It was brilliant , and it was really inspiring . Aie a Mwana , issued in 1981 on indie label Demon Records , was n t a hit , but it earned a spin by legendary tastemaker DJ John Peel and coverage in the zeitgeist-capturing glossy The Face which in turn caught the attention of former Specials member Terry Hall . The next thing they knew , Bananarama were singing backup on It Ai n t What You Do , It s the Way That You Do It , a single by Hall s new group , Fun Boy Three , that made the top five on the U.K. charts . Fun Boy Three later repaid the favor by appearing on Bananarama s own hit single , a cover of Motown girl group the Velvelettes Really Saying Something , which also went top five . It all happened really , really quickly , says Fahey . Fame came very quickly to us , before we even had a chance to think . We did n t have any goals we just loved music , loved dancing , loved making music , and just wanted to be in a band . We had n t thought beyond that . I mean , we only had two rehearsals before we had the opportunity to make a demo in [ Paul Cook s ] 24-track studio . … Within six months of forming , not really knowing what we were doing and just trying to figure it out , all of a sudden we re on Top of the Pops with the Fun Boy Three . And we re still signing on and getting [ unemployment ] benefits ! We had three top five singles in our first year , but we were on the dole throughout . … [ That s why ] there s a slew of self-pity on the first album . Like the song ‘ What a Shambles , for example , where we re so confused because everybody thinks we must be living like millionaires , but we were living like everybody else . We had no money at all and were just on the bus and doing our laundry , but yeah , people think we must be riding around in limos . Bananarama s fame , and presumably fortune , increased stateside in 1984 with Cruel Summer their first American top 10 hit , thanks to a placement in The Karate Kid but it was 1986 s Venus that propelled them to No. 1 in five countries ( including the U.S. ) and transformed them into pop divas . Gone were the thrift-store finds , handmade fashion-student glad rags , and ratty hair of their tomboyish post-punk urchin look , along with the rougher sound of their first two LPs . This marked the beginning of Bananarama s partnership with future superproducers Stock Aitken Waterman , who d go on to massive success with Rick Astley , Kylie Minogue , and Samantha Fox . But it was SAW s 1985 breakthrough production for another pioneering British post-punk group , Dead or Alive , that caught Bananarama s attention . ‘ You Spin Me Round ( Like a Record ) , when that came out , it kind of blew our minds , Fahey remembers . We were like , ‘ Who produced that ? Let s get the producers who did that record and make a version of [ Venus ] that sounds like that ! This was before they became the hit factory that they went on to become . It may seem like an almost inconceivable sonic leap to go from Aie a Mwana ( a Swahili-language , Paul Cook-produced cover of a song by African-Belgian band Black Blood ) to something as polished and produced as Venus , but Fahey insists it was a natural evolution . If you do n t follow the trajectory , then yes , the two [ eras ] are very different , but there was a whole growth period . ‘ Cruel Summer sounds nothing like ‘ Really Saying Something . And then there was ‘ Trick of the Night and ‘ Rough Justice . There were lots of different phases before we hit on ‘ Venus . The Stock Aitken Waterman-produced albums True Confessions and WOW ! , in 1986 and 87 , yielded several radio-ready hits , but Fahey , who had just married Eurythmics Dave Stewart , quit the group a year later leaving Dallin and Woodward to carry on first with replacement singer Jacquie O Sullivan , then as a duo . I was sort of pulled in a different direction , being called in a different direction creatively , explains Fahey , who went on to form the Goth-pop duo Shakespears Sister , a forerunner of sorts to spooky electro-chanteuses like Grimes , Banks , Zola Jesus , and Chelsea Wolfe . The band went into unashamed ultra-pop , and at the same time I was going through a bit of a darker phase in my life , and I wanted to write some stuff that was more personal that would n t have belonged in Bananarama . Fahey jokes , I walked away from Bananarama when it was absolutely at its peak , but that seems to be a habit of mine , because I did the same in Shakespears Sister ! While Shakespears Sister never became a household name in the States , they scored two top 10 albums and won Brit Awards and Ivor Novello Awards in the U.K. , and one of their singles , the ethereal ballad Stay , topped the British charts for eight weeks . However , by 1993 Fahey had fired her bandmate , Marcella Detroit , and Shakespears Sister went on hiatus the following year . Fahey busied herself with raising her two sons by Stewart ( whom she divorced in 1996 ) , releasing occasional records by Shakespears Sister ( which she revived as a solo project in 2009 ) , penning music for other artists , and working on a script I ve been wanting to write for the past 15 years in her adopted home city of Los Angeles . There were two brief reunions with Bananarama in 1998 to record a cover of ABBA s Waterloo for a Eurovision TV special called A Song for Eurotrash , and in 2002 for a 20th anniversary concert at London s G-A-Y nightclub , which they claimed would be their last ever appearance . After that , among rumors that Fahey s split from the group had been acrimonious , it seemed like the chances of a full-fledged Bananarama comeback were about as good as the likelihood of Morrissey and Johnny Marr ever putting the Smiths back together . Then , out of the blue , in early December [ 2016 ] , Keren FaceTimed me , recalls Fahey . She said , ‘ I want to ask you something , and I do n t want you to give me your answer immediately . Just think about it . She said , ‘ We tour all the time without you , and you have no idea how much we re loved and how much our music means to people . We miss you , and it s not the same without you , and we want you to tour with us . Fahey admits she had reservations at first . Though she insists there is no bad blood between her and her Bananarama co-founders , she concedes , We were best friends who formed a band , so it was a really intense relationship . We lived in each other s pockets 24/7 [ in the 1980s ] . We lived in the same flat when we started off , then we bought three houses next door to each other . Our inner circle was the same . It was a very close and intense relationship , and I guess it just started to crack . Maybe I was getting on their nerves or whatever . Somebody s got to be a whipping boy ! Our friendship was under strain at that point anyway . We were just growing in different directions . This was like a marriage , and there s no divorce without a lot of emotional pain . Now , however , Fahey is thrilled to take care of unfinished business and revisit Bananarama s legacy . I think there s been a whole new repositioning of women in society [ since the 80s ] , and finally women [ in music ] are being given a lot more credit , she says . The assumption that female pop stars are puppets is no longer made . But you know , it never even occurred to us that we were n t as good as any guy , and that we could n t and should n t have respect . We did n t think of ourselves as a ‘ girl band we happened to be three girls who formed a band . … Now we want to do a magnificent show that is a celebration of everything that we achieved .

		"paragraph": "We could n't have picked a better person to launch Yahoo TV 's Ask the Fans series with than Julie Plec , executive producer of The Vampire Diaries and The Originals . Devoted viewers of her shows are known for their passion and voice , and they definitely spoke up when we posted Plec 's 10 questions for them . We received more than 600 carefully-composed emails from close to 20 countries ( Sweden to Serbia ) . We poured over the answers , then phoned Plec to discuss the most popular and insightful . We 'll divide our report into two parts . Come back Feb. 12 for our discussion with Plec who wrote the Feb. 9 episode of The Originals , \" The Devil is Damned \" covering the answers to her questions on \" shipper \" fervor , favorite kisses , songs most associated with the shows , crossover ideas , the writers fans would most like to meet , and fan fiction . JULIE PLEC ASKS : Tell me about the first time you saw TVD and where you were and why you watched . ANALYZING THE ANSWERS : Of course you have those who watched the premiere because they 'd read the books upon which the series is based or are fans of the vampire genre in general . ( Though sometimes , the latter actually worked against the show , as Maria from Paraguay explained : \" I loved Twilight so much that my first thought was : ' THIS SHOW IS JUST TRYING TO COPY MY BABY , THERE 'S NO WAY I 'M WATCHING IT . ' And then I did . Somehow I felt that I was cheating on Twilight , but I could n't resist it . I was a 13-year-old girl ! \" Others were curious because it was from Dawson 's Creek creator/Scream writer Kevin Williamson or they recognized stars Ian Somerhalder ( Lost ) , Nina Dobrev ( Degrassi : The Next Generation ) , and Paul Wesley . As Jayme , a 21-year-old college student , is now willing to admit : \" I will not lie , I bought a teen magazine and saw a locker poster for the show and after one good look at Paul Wesley , I knew I had to watch the show . ( P.S. I 've never told anyone that ! I mean I was in high school ! ) \" What 's noteworthy is the large number of fans who caught up on the show via Netflix after a friend ( sister , aunt , cousin , etc. ) insisted . People like 28-year-old Stephanie Perez from New Jersey , who gave it a chance two years ago because she was accompanying a friend to a fan convention : \" So I started to watch it on Netflix thinking I was going to hate it . Well I was hooked from the first episode , really the very first scene . It was scary and dark everything that I love about vampire myths . \" Others , like Jess , who became a fan during a Chicago blizzard , were looking for a new show to binge and decided to give the one they saw everyone tweeting about a go : \" I ended up skipping most of my classes for probably two weeks because I was too busy binge-watching this damn show . So thank you for that . Nevertheless , it was worth it , and I always feel that initial warmth and comfort whenever I watch an old episode of TVD because of those small moments . So , honestly , thank you for that . \" A sampling of particularly fun stories : \" My wife made me do it , \" Tom LeNoir wrote . \" I continue watching because I enjoy the characters that are crazy and murderers trying to act normal . \" And from a woman who signed her email as \" Mom \" : \" This is such a funny story ! My daughter would try to kick us all out of the basement and urged me to keep her brothers away from her . She demanded no interruptions on Thursday nights and I was quite the pest , poking around because after all , my laundry room was there . One night to her absolute HORROR I sat with a load of laundry on the sofa and decided to fold the clothes right there next to her . I said , ' Let me see what you 're always making such a fuss about . ' I asked questions and tried peeking at her tweets and completely ruined the episode for her , but she was convinced TVD would n't be my cup of tea . Oh well ... she was wrong . \" PLEC RESPONDS : That 's so cute . I have two fun ones . The first is , we were at Comic-Con last year , and all these 12-year-olds kept coming up to me and telling me how much they loved the show and the 13-year-olds were screaming and crying over Ian . I looked at Ian , and I 'm like , \" The show has been on for six years . These girls would have been seven when it started . There 's no way they were watching this show at seven . \" So we started asking them how they watched the show , and they had all started watching it on Netflix two months prior . Every single girl I talked to in that age range had just started on Netflix within the last three months , and every single girl in her class was binge-watching The Vampire Diaries and had caught up completely , and it was all anyone was talking about in the 7th and the 8th grade , which I loved . It 's sad for broadcast ratings , but great for living on in the hearts and minds of the world . I love that a whole new generation of people are finding the show and loving it just as much as the people who found it in the beginning . The other is , there 's this restaurant in Atlanta that I 'm probably at three nights a week , so the bartenders and the waiters now know what my name is and what I do . The bartender is this guy who 's easily in his late thirties . He comes in one night , and he 's like , \" OK , so I just started watching . I 'm into Season 2 . I 'm binge-watching because I feel like now that I know you , I 've got to see what you do . \" Over four weeks , he binge-watched the entire series and got so upset because he caught up to air and found out that we were going on hiatus for six weeks . He was so sad , but I loved it . He 's like , \" I just had to see what you did , \" and now he 's obsessed . Related : ' Vampire Diaries ' Recap : The Best and Worst of ' The Day I Tried to Live ' PLEC ASKS : Do you like watching live , or would you rather save up a bunch of episodes and binge-watch ? ANALYZING THE ANSWERS : In short , though a lot of viewers clearly love the binge experience when discovering a show , most choose to watch live to share in the experience with other fans and to not get spoiled . ( That 's especially true and impressive ! coming from some of the international fans who wrote in about watching livestreams at 2 a.m. , 3 a.m. , or 4 a.m. their time . ) For some people , like Cindy Bush and her three daughters , watching live is a family affair : \" Now that one is married and moved out , we sometimes text at commercials about the show . I even have my mother involved ( she 's 75 ) . She 's a Stefan fan but I 'm a Damon gal . Family feud ! \" Others , such as mother-of-seven Tammy Merryweather , have to wait until their family is asleep : \" So next best thing is me and my group of fellow TVD lovers getting together every Thursday night and watching it on DVR a couple of hours after it airs , when all the kiddos are in bed and we can scream and gnash our teeth and speculate and gasp and awwww all together ! \" ( \" Oh my god , love it , \" Plec says . ) When established fans are most likely to binge is over the summer : More than one said they 'll watch the entire series then to get ready for the next season . PLEC RESPONDS : Obviously , as a loyal soldier of The CW , and someone who works in and is determined to protect the success and integrity of broadcast television , I would like everybody to watch it live . But as a human being , I just watched The Wire in its entire run and got all five seasons in over five weeks and have never been so blown away by a television experience in my life . I did that three years ago for Game of Thrones . I caught up , started at the beginning , and over four days watched three seasons . There is something so amazing about binge-watching because you really see the writers and how they set things up to pay things off , and how lines come back to echo lines that were from previous seasons . When you watch it all at once , you can really feel the writers ' commitment to the show and all the details . Whereas , if you watch it once a week , you forget week-to-week what was done the week before . I remember they were airing Buffy on FX every day , two episodes a day , so my friend and I would watch two episodes a day every day for three months . So we started at the beginning and got all caught up to where it was airing . I watched what Joss Whedon did , the season he would plan , the Easter eggs that would be in there . You know how Jonathan [ played by Danny Strong ] was an extra in the pilot and then became a villain in whatever season he became a villain that , to me , in binge-watching was so fascinating . So there 's a personal argument to be made for both . Business-wise , please watch live . [ Laughs . ] Related : ' Vampire Diaries ' Recap : The Best and Worst of ' Prayer for the Dying ' PLEC ASKS : What moment made you cry the most over the last six seasons of The Vampire Diaries ? ANALYZING THE ANSWERS : There are so many to choose from , as most fans acknowledged , that we could only single out the most popular responses to Plec . * Let 's start with the happy tears : Damon and Stefan 's reunion after Damon returns from the Other Side in Season 6 . \" Honestly , \" Kaitlin wrote , \" Stefan and Damon 's reunion had me curled up in a ball on the floor , crying to my grandma , who watched it with me . I have a brother , so I can understand where Stefan was coming from ... \" As Ashley Calafiore said , \" The last scene in 6x05 proves how much these brothers love each other . My sister and my mom watch the show with me , too , and they rarely ever cry , and for that scene , my mom turned to me and was like , ' This is when I love the show , when you see the show focused on a different kind of love , a brotherly love . \" PLEC RESPONDS : That was one of my favorite cries of this season , and I love that people love that because to me , the show has always been , in my heart , just as much about the brothers as it has been about Elena 's relationships with each of them . Taking these brothers from a place of absolute hatred of each other , revisiting them in flashbacks to see that there used to be love there , and then seeing how they ca n't quit each other no matter what . After six years and extreme loss , finally seeing them come together with pure , unadulterated love for each other made me so happy . * And now for the sad tears : Elena turning off her humanity after Jeremy 's death in Season 4 . As Ashtyn Carvalho wrote , \" Seeing Elena , a character based on her kindness and empathy , have to turn off her emotions broke my heart . Knowing that she was so unable to go on that she had to turn her back on who she was just to remain intact was very powerful . \" Alison Andres was among those who seconded it : \" Elena 's quotes and behavior were so emotional and made me feel like I was part of the scene . \" PLEC RESPONDS : The beauty of that scene where Elena is flipping out after her brother dies is it 's just so pure and raw and very honest . I 'm sure a lot of people who watch our show have experienced some level of grief in their life , whether it be losing a grandparent , a parent , a friend , a sibling . Those who have understand that grief kind of attacks you in very unique and not necessarily predictable ways and it can make you shut down hard . Allegorically , the humanity switch is about how to escape grief . It 's about disassociating from the sadness , and in this particular case , Elena , who had been through everything and thought she had experienced everything , finally hit the wall of the one thing that she could n't take control of , she could n't get past , she could n't handle gracefully . It just had to strip her bare . I love that scene so much . It 's one of my favorites of the whole series , for sure . * Caroline 's father 's death and drowning Elena 's flashback to her parents ' deaths in Season 3 . We 're going to let Australian fan Gee , who said these two scenes tie for her , speak for all those who picked either of them : \" I will never ever forget Bill 's line , ' parents are n't supposed to outlive their children ' it 's tragic , it 's true and chilling . At the heart of The Vampire Diaries has always been this concept of growing up , and moments ( or actions ) ' that set things in motion . ' This scene did n't have anything to do with the love triangle it was simply about a little girl losing her dad too soon . [ Candice ] Accola 's acting was on-point ( it always is ) , and in this instance words can not even do justice the brilliant delivery of this scene : Caroline 's purely human agony and her father 's calm acceptance of his fate is something forever branded into my memory . The death of Miranda and Grayson had a similar affect : that powerlessness and utter hopelessness of being unable to escape a horrific fate . Grayson wordlessly telling his daughter to stop fighting was arguably one of the most heartbreaking moments in the show . I find it interesting that people brand The Vampire Diaries as ultimately only being ' romantic , ' and not ' family-orientated ' like The Originals because it 's actually scenes like this family scenes that you probably do n't think have a massive effect in the greater scheme of the show ... that do . Because , essentially , while ' love changes ' our characters , it is pivotal moments like these that define them ( and the course of their lives ) . \" PLEC RESPONDS : I love that . Kevin and my relationship goes back a long way , and each of us has experienced in our lives some different forms of loss . This show , I think , is a vehicle and always has been for each of us to work out our own emotions and feelings about love and loss and grief and that empty sadness of being left alone , whether it 's losing a parent or losing a loved one . If you look at the series as a whole , that 's what 's running underneath it the entire time . From minute one , when we meet Elena , this is a girl who lost her parents and is trying to pull her life back together . It 's really what the show at its core has always been about . So sometimes we get to play in the beautiful world of the death of a character . The character deaths are always my favorite . They 're heartbreaking to say goodbye to an actor and say goodbye to a character , but to write that passing or to write that loss is very cathartic . * Alaric 's death in Season 3 . As Lucas wrote , \" The one moment that makes me ugly cry every time I see it , or even think about it , is when the camera pans over everyone gathered outside the Salvatore tomb when Alaric decides not to make the transition . \" For Anna C , it was the conversation between Alaric and Damon inside : \" It is one of the most heart-wrenching and raw moments of the show for me because in that moment , Alaric and Damon were completely honest and open with each other , and it was clear how much that moment was destroying them . Also , that man tear that rolls down Alaric 's cheek during the scene gets me Every . Single . Time . \" PLEC RESPONDS : Oh yeah . My favorite death . The Fray 's \" Be Still \" I ca n't hear that song without weeping . * Bonnie 's funeral in Season 5 . \" Her speech to each person at the funeral was deeply emotional and personal to each character . It was a good payback to the viewers as well , \" Annabella Grenaldi wrote . Lisa Moore pinpointed the moment that many said hit them hard : \" I was weeping to begin with , but when Matt Donovan [ played by Zach Roerig ] was sobbing , I just totally lost it . \" PLEC RESPONDS : That was my favorite cry of last season . This year , people are always saying , \" You 've put Bonnie all alone , and she does n't have a storyline , \" and I 'm like , \" You 're crazy , she has the storyline . Bonnie 's journey this year what she has to go through , and what she has to survive , and what her life will be like once she has survived it is one of my favorite long-running character storylines that we 've ever done . I 'm glad that people emotionally are responding to it . \" * Damon 's goodbye to Elena in the Season 5 finale . As Jennifer Rethwish from Long Beach , Calif. , wrote , \" It was so sad to watch her realizing that she lost him . And the speech he gave was so poetic . \" Morgana Corr a took it further : \" My god , that scene breaks my heart . I still cry every time I watch that scene . Elena is so sad , one part of her heart died that night ... and Damon trying to calm her , but she was n't able to see him ... I 'm remembering now and I 'm almost crying . \" PLEC RESPONDS : Yes . It 's funny , everybody 's got their own moment . Episode 14 [ airing Feb. 12 ] has become my new [ all-time ] favorite cry , but prior to that , my favorite cry was when Damon said goodbye to Rose [ played by Lauren Cohan ] and gave her her perfect memory . PLEC ASKS : Do you LOVE spoilers , HATE spoilers , or IGNORE spoilers ? ANALYZING THE ANSWERS : Fans are all over the map on this one , as expected . Like Liz , some are very pro : \" I love them !!! It gives me something to look forward to and [ I can ] make up my own scenarios in my mind as to what could happen with the spoilers we were given . \" They like to be able to say \" I told you so ! \" when they guess right . Others , who want to be totally surprised , hate them or prefer to ignore them . Then there are those whose relationship with spoilers was best expressed by Kirsten Howes : \" I hate to love spoilers , \" she wrote . \" I ca n't help myself from soaking up as much details on all my shows that I possibly can , but then sometimes I find that one spoiler ... that one spoiler . Then I regret ever searching ' spoilers ' on Google news , and I theorize everything until the episode airs . And holy crap , I think that is the most accurate description of my life ever . \" Related : ' Vampire Diaries ' Recap : The Best and Worst of ' Woke Up With a Monster ' PLEC RESPONDS : I used to be a total anti-spoiler Nazi because I just thought it was completely unacceptable for any story point to get leaked out there . I 've loosened my fervor on it a bit , because I think there are spoilers that get people talking and get people excited . But what drives me crazy is the leaks . It 's the way that the press or the Internet gets scripts , and then if the wrong journalist decides on the wrong day to just print whatever they want , without kind of thinking what it might do to the fans , an entire storyline or surprise can be ruined . You 're basically violating someone else 's right to enjoy the show without knowing what 's going on when you just put it up in an article or you put it up in a chat board . So I get more angry at the violation of somebody who 's on our set or in our world who 's handing scripts out to reporters and/or to other fans . To me , I feel robbed and I feel betrayed . Whereas the people who know what 's happening but work very hard to figure out how to tease it without spoiling anything , I 'm like , \" Thank you , \" because that 's servicing the fan experience in the right way . [ A special note for West Coast and international fans , who complained in general about official show Twitter accounts posting blatant spoilers , Plec has your back . \" One of our accounts used to do that , and I emailed them .

Prince Harry and the new royal , who landed in Dublin Tuesday afternoon following an eventful two days in London , are visiting select states belonging to the European Union , just two years after the UK voted to leave in Brexit . For the occasion , the Duchess opted for a green long-sleeved dress by her go-to designer , a hue that she had previously sported at Prince Louis ' christening the previous day . She accessorized the look with a beige tote and matching suede shoes , and favoring her usual go-to bun .

The film is based on the true story of black detective Ron Stallworth , who infiltrated the hate group and talked with Duke in the 1970s . He and director Spike Lee were interviewed on NBC Nightly News Monday . Lee happily prompted Stallworth to reveal to Lester Holt the latest development . Stallworth laughed and said , The latest development was I got a phone call yesterday from David Duke . Lee laughed as Stallworth continued . He wanted to talk about the fact that he s concerned about how he s going to be portrayed in this film . He complimented Spike . He said , ‘ I ve always respected Spike Lee , which surprised the heck out of me . Topher Grace , who plays Duke in the film , was interviewed Tuesday morning on the Today show . He said Duke s demeanor , such as his ability to compliment Spike Lee , is one of his most dangerous qualities . This is what s so evil about him and continues to be so evil about him , is that he , at this period of time in the 70s , put a new face on racism . He kind of rebranded it and made it more palatable . So kind of the nicer he is , I always felt like that made him more evil . The actor , who said he would never want to speak to the former leader of the KKK , reacted to Duke s concern that he might be seen negatively in the film , saying , Too late now , buddy . Stallworth , the real-life cop behind BlacKkKlansman , still keeps his KKK membership card on him . Read more from Yahoo Entertainment :",

		"paragraph": "( Bloomberg ) -- Israeli aircraft struck dozens of targets across the Gaza Strip overnight following rocket barrages on southern Israel . The flare in violence , which caused no serious casualties , followed another deadly confrontation Friday during Palestinian protests along the Gaza-Israel border . Health officials in Hamas-ruled Gaza reported that Israeli troops killed five Palestinians , and a sixth died while making a homemade bomb . The Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility for the rocket attacks , saying they were in response to the deaths on Friday . Around midday , it said in a statement that it had agreed at Egypt s behest to cease fire and keep the situation from deteriorating further . The Israeli military said it viewed the rocket assault severely and held Hamas responsible for anything that happens in the enclave . It accused the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Iran s Al - Quds Force of being behind the bombardments . Rockets Intercepted More than 30 launches were identified from Gaza beginning late Friday , the Israeli military said , and about a dozen were intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system . Israeli aircraft struck around 95 sites , including weapons manufacturing facilities and military compounds including Hamas s security services headquarters , it said . Other targets included the entrance to a tunnel dug to infiltrate and attack Israel , and an anti-aircraft observation post , it said . Gaza Health Ministry official Ashra al-Qedra said an airstrike on northern Gaza leveled an empty four-story building . A hospital near one of the targets was slightly damaged , he said . Confrontations between Gaza and Israel began escalating in late March after Palestinians launched a campaign of weekly Friday protests against Israel . Israeli snipers deployed on the border have killed more than 210 Palestinians , and one Israeli soldier was killed by sniper fire from Gaza . The Gaza protest campaign has included frequent attempts to cut through the 10-foot-high ( 3-meter ) wire border fence to enter Israel . Gazans have also sent flaming balloons and kites over the border , setting fire to thousands of acres of forest and agricultural land .

		"paragraph": "In addition to the thousands of murders , this season of Game of Thrones entertained us in one crucial way : It surprised us . From inspiring uncomfortable think pieces about whether rape is entertaining to courting speculation about how a series can adapt books that have n t even been written yet , Season 5 has been knee-deep in strong opinions and absolutely swarmed by question marks . What do we expect of this show ? What do we deserve from this show ? Are we even having fun ? Mother s Mercy was as brutal and shocking a gut-punch as its preceding nine episodes openly warned us it would be , yet the only conclusion we could come to was this : Game of Thrones is a tremendous work of art , and even in the depths of its depravity and heights of its insanity we must be grateful for the shock . In an age of endless entertainment options , surprises are currency , and no show is wealthier than this one . If that sounds like overly academic excuse-making , it s probably because I m beating around the bush . Because on the other side of that bush is a pile of corpses , some of whom used to be important and beloved characters ! Jon Snow , Stannis Baratheon , Myrcella , Selyse , Myranda , Ser Meryn . And standing near those corpses are characters with ever worsening frown-lines : Cersei , Arya , Daenerys , Melisandre . Things went badly for A LOT of people this episode , including and especially we the viewers . We ll have a year to mourn , but for now let s talk about all that carnage ! Last week s episode ended with the sight of a woman riding a dragon into the sky , but hopefully you did n t forget that the scene immediately before that one involved a child getting burned at the stake by her own parents . Because that happened ! And perhaps the only way we comforted ourselves in the six days since has been the hope that perhaps Shireen s death was n t for naught . Perhaps the Lord of Light would indeed give Stannis some kind of advantage to justify such a heinous act . And guess what ? He did . The Lord of Light melted some icicles ! God is truly great . If we re being honest , Stannis was n t exactly stoked about the melting icicles . In fact , he was being very crabby . Nobody is saying that burning your own daughter at the stake is a good time , but why so grumpy , Stannis ? It probably did n t help that after said murder , half his army ran away and his wife committed suicide . Oh , Selyse . Yes , she had been mostly awful and had seemed fine with Shireen s murder at first , but at least she eventually did change her mind at the last minute . Credit where credit s due . Stannis s day really took a turn for the worse when he decided to set up camp outside Winterfell and realized that maybe openly marching an army that close to his enemy s base would cause them to attack suddenly . So the war came early ! And then the war ended early ! Yes , it definitely felt like the show had spent all of its special effects budget on White Walkers and dragons , so this cutaway was one of the more comical ones in Game of Thrones history . From attacking soldiers to piles of corpses in the blink of an eye ! Next thing we knew Stannis was ambling through the woods knife-fighting soldiers and bleeding everywhere . But then his true angel of death arrived . Oh god , yes . Brienne has barely been in this season , but this moment was so righteous and perfect , I got chills . She finally got to avenge the death of Renly Baratheon , going so far as to get Stannis to confess he d used blood magic , thus giving her the peace of mind she needed no , she did n t hallucinate that shadow baby . So yeah : Brienne killed Stannis ! Bye , jerk ! Meanwhile , Sansa s timing was really weird in this episode . First she broke out of her room using that corkscrew she d pocketed a few episodes back ( but dropped it on the floor conspicuously as she fled ) and then she tried to light a candle in the tower window even though Brienne was n t even watching anymore . Sansa , get it together ! We were supposed to think she was finally asserting her independence , but it was a pretty weak showing overall . I mean , when she came face-to-face with Myranda , all Sansa could do was sass her , and meanwhile REEK was the one to save the day by pushing Myranda over the side of the wall ! Obviously , the sight of Myranda s body splatting against cobblestone was highly satisfying , because she was a major jerk also ! But also FINALLY Theon was emerging from his Reek personality a little more . Been waiting all season for that . Next thing we knew he was taking Sansa s hand and they were jumping off the building ( from the same height that splattered Myranda ) and we did n t see them land . Tune in next season to see if Sansa and Theon survived ! ( They probably did . ) Jerk No. 3 bit the dust when Arya went undercover at the brothel as a child prostitute and did n t wince when Ser Meryn Trant tried to beat her with a stick . But rather than dwell on what exactly was going on in that room prior to Arya ripping off her face and stabbing him in the eyes , let s just appreciate the fact that Arya was now a full-blown assassin . I mean , look at the bad-ass cold stare she had when she slit his throat ! For being a scene about a gruesome murder , it sure was crowd-pleasing . Ser Meryn was a bad person if we re being honest with ourselves . Unfortunately , Arya s extracurricular killing was a big faux pas back at the House of Black and White , and Jaqen made it a teachable moment . By poisoning himself ! Except then he jumped out from behind a pillar all psyche ! and Arya peeled a ton of faces off the poisoned corpse until she found her own , and it was all very dream-logicky . But you know which part was real ? Arya went blind ! So that s what s up with Arya now . She s blind . A blind assassin . Will it be a permanent state , or will she regain her vision during yet another teachable moment ? Tune in next season . Good riddance to this Dorne plot . I mean it was fine at first , but who kept hitting the snooze button ? The Sand Snakes in particular were really disappointing . Anyway , it was time for Jaime and Myrcella and Bronn and Dreamy Trystane to sail back to Kings Landing , and all the weirdo Dorne folk said goodbye in their own ways . Like , uh , Ellaria kissing Myrcella on the mouth for a really long time . Totally normal . Later on the boat , there was a touching scene in which Jaime attempted to have the birds and the bees talk with Myrcella ( is it a birds and bees talk if you re trying to tell your niece that she s your daughter ? ) , and Myrcella embraced him as her father . But the celebration was short-lived , as Myrcella started bleeding from every face hole and then collapsed dead ! Because , you guessed it , Ellaria had poisoned her with that one poison the topless Sand Snake had used on Bronn in jail . So there she was , squirting the antidote Gusher into her mouth and starting a war between the houses that will probably never end . Cool move , lady . Back in Meereen , Daenerys s crew were trying to figure out what to do now that she d flown away on a dragon . Because Meereen is the worst city possible , nobody seemed super stoked about running it . So after tons of bickering , Daario and Ser Jorah decided to jump on their horsies and go find Khaleesi , while Tyrion and Missandei and Grey Worm were going to stay in Meereen and hate life . Fortunately , though , an old friendly face arrived just in time . Hey , Varys ! Where you been ? Anyway , he s another character that did n t do too much this season , but it made me immediately happy to see him again . Welcome back , baldy . As for Dany , she was out on some hillside where Drogon was slurping at bones and refusing to wake up from his nap . He even bucked her off when she tried to get him to fly back to Meereen ! Since getting Drogon to do anything was a no-go at this point , Dany decided to go look for food . Instead of food , all she found were ten thousand hunks in leather vests riding horses all around her ! Yep : The Dothraki were back ! But would they accept Dany as their Khaleesi again ? Will she be marrying their leader again ? It s anybody s guess . But it made me nostalgic for Season 1 , so I ll take it . This was tough but riveting : Cersei kinda-sorta confessed to one of her accusations that she d sat 'n spun on Lancel a ton and as a reward she was allowed to return to the Red Keep . But only AFTER her atonement , which is safe to say did not look very fun . First there was the violent razor-blade haircut , then the full-naked walk of shame through a public square full of haters . Yup , in addition to flashing their junk at Cersei and saying rude things , they also threw raw sewage at her . You know what ? Kings Landing is also horrible . Meereen and Kings Landing should jump off a cliff holding hands . Burn them both down and salt the ashes . Enough with these people . The amazing thing about this scene ( which honestly felt like it was about 45-minutes long ) was that Cersei absolutely deserved comeuppance for unleashing the religious right onto her people , yet her treatment here was so horrible that I began to root for her again . I had no choice ! She was truly put through hell and now I want nothing more than to see her regroup and erase the Sparrows from existence . But guess who s back and ready to help her ? The reanimated corpse of The Mountain ! Yep , in what appears to be a Frankenstein s monster situation , the big lug is all purple-faced and mute , and he immediately carried Cersei around like some kind of bizarro Hodor . VERY interested to see where this goes . Tune in next season . Early in the episode Sam revealed to Jon Snow that he did sex and also wanted to leave Castle Black , because Sam is not a moron . His reasoning had something to do with Gilly being unsafe , but I m pretty sure it had a lot to do with the ten thousand-strong zombie army currently bearing down on the wall . You know ? That s a good opportunity to call it quits . Unfortunately this meant that Jon Snow s best and only friend was taking off , leaving him to deal with a castle full of haters on his own . At this point Melisandre arrived , shell-shocked . Stannis her No. 1 hobby for several years running was dead . All her prophecies and visions had been wrong . That is a lot for a fire priestess to handle ! Without saying much of anything she informed Davos that all was lost , and Shireen was dead too . Then she went to her room and took a siesta or whatever . Melisandre definitely had some thinking to do . Then came the episode s ultimate sucker punch : The straight-up Julius Caesaring of Jon Snow ! His compatriots summoned him onto the terrace where he encountered a sign marked Traitor and then everybody stabbed him ! Ugh , these jerks . Their mantra was For the Watch , meaning they were mad that their friends had died fighting the White Walkers on behalf of the Wildlings , even though , uh guys ? Maybe stop being all butt-hurt about that and realize that an ARMY OF ZOMBIES was fast approaching . But there would be no swaying these jerks . Not even Lil Olly could be placated . Jon Snow was stabbed and stabbed and stabbed and stabbed . Truly a brutal and unrelenting death . And by death I mean all his blood spilled out of his body and his pupils dilated like crazy and the end credits rolled . But come on , do we REALLY think he s dead for real ? I believe that he s maybe biologically dead for the moment , but is n t there a wizardess on the premises with experience in resurrection ? Or is that option too obvious ? Who cares , just as long as Jon Snow DOES NOT DIE FOREVER . Out of all the shocking deaths on this show , the death of Jon Snow feels particularly wrong and unforgivable and I think this could be the one where the show is like , Just kidding , he s fine . But that s all speculation at this point . At this point Jon Snow is dead . DEAD . Dead . Game of Thrones , you reprehensible destructor . Why have you wrecking balled our hearts so ? This is what we signed up for . Game of Thrones will always be this way . We can scream , lament , curse the sky , whatever it takes for us to exorcise the unpleasant emotions this show provokes in us . But remember that it does get a rise out of us , and that s invaluable . That being said , and more so than any season before , we can probably be glad there are only ten episodes at a time . The human heart can only take so much . Same time next year ? What was your favorite moment from Mother s Mercy ?",

		"paragraph": "If there has been a theme of the 2018 World Cup through five days , it has been underwhelming performances from favorites . Entering Monday , of the six nations most commonly tipped for success in Russia , four had failed to win . A fifth had needed VAR , an own goal and goal-line technology to scrape by an underdog . And the sixth ? The sixth was Belgium , which kicked off its campaign against Panama in Sochi on Monday . And despite what scoreboards will tell you , it fell in line with the trend . The Red Devils beat Panama 3-0 behind Dries Mertens , Kevin De Bruyne , Eden Hazard and Romelu Lukaku . But they sputtered in a game through which many expected them to stroll . And they needed an early contender for goal of the tournament to bail them out . Mertens broke a 0-0 tie with a majestic 47th-minute volley : And from there , the game opened up for the Belgians . But they had to work for their three points . Belgium has as much top-tier attacking talent as any team in Russia . But against a Panamanian side content to sit deep , and determined to rupture the game s rhythm with foul after foul , the favorites had trouble in the first half . Both Hazard and Mertens , playing as wide forwards behind Lukaku , struggled to find space behind a crowded five-man Panamanian midfield . Panama s fouls functioned just as planned . And Belgium was sloppy . It under-hit passes out to wingbacks . It mis-hit through-balls and took a few shoddy first touches in important moments . At halftime , a draw was n t difficult to envision . But Mertens broke the deadlock in style , and the game changed . Panama was always going to get one chance . One chance to score a famous goal and nab a famous result . That chance came after 54 minutes . Belgium is borderline incapable of a complete defensive clampdown because it has players like Yannick Carrasco , a true attacking winger , shouldering responsibility . The left wingback switched off with Panama maintaining some rare attacking-half possession . Panamanian right back Michael Murillo sprinted past him , and in behind the Belgian defense . Murillo s shot was turned away by Thibaut Courtois , though , and it was the last clear look at goal Los Canaleros would get while a draw was within reach . They had to chase the game , but just were n t capable . And once they came out of their defensive shell , they were hopeless . One moment of brilliance from De Bruyne put the game to bed . He poked a swerving cross into a dangerous area . Lukaku , who was barely onside , powered his header in for 2-0 :",

The brash Irishman moved ahead in the featherweight rankings with a first round TKO win over Dustin Poirier at UFC 178 , but the unfortunate manner in which it ended still left plenty of questions regarding not just the fight but the rising star 's ability to take on and possibly take out the very best in the world . After a good number of striking combinations thrown from both men , with mostly only glancing connections for either , McGregor caught a ducking Poirier with a left hook to the back of the head . The American appeared to go out and fell to the mat . McGregor followed up with strikes to the downed Poirier , forcing referee Herb Dean to step in and call a stop to the fight . Strictly speaking , strikes to the back of the head area that McGregor hit Poirier on are not allowed in unified MMA rules . However , Dean either did n't notice the placement of the quick shot or , decided no foul could be called because McGregor 's punch seemed to be aimed and thrown at a legal area of Poirier before the Louisiana fighter ducked into it . In either case , McGregor moves on in the 145 pound class with this high-profile , though controversial win , and was quick to call for a title shot in his post-fight interview with Joe Rogan . \" What the other featherweights do n't understand , is that it 's a whole ‘ nother game when they get hit by me , \" McGregor told interviewer Joe Rogan . \" The world title is next . \" Follow Elias on Twitter @EliasCepeda & @YahooCagewriter",

( It s too bad fitness superstar Christmas has been sidelined in some competitions by her busted foot : She s the unique houseguest this season who combines both smarts and strength . ) The brains/brawn concept finds unity in the cuddling couple of Jessica/Cody , which is the main reason the duo has been such a semi-impressive threat thus far . ( I add that semi modifier because Cody is such a sullen boor and bore it s clear his initial power surge was ignited solely on his good looks : He seemed , to people arriving in the house and getting their bearings , like a dashing leader of men and women . It took a while for his moodiness to start weighing everything down . ) Paul all febrile nerve endings and anxious yelling is the game veteran , the one who perceived Jessica and Cody s weaknesses most quickly . Thus far , you re likely to be evicted if you re brainy without social skills ( Cameron Dominique ) , or brainy without game-playing shrewdness ( Ramses ) , or brawny without the smarts . Josh , solidly in that latter category , has settled into being the man with a permanent target on his back , and why not ? Would n t you want to jettison the guy who slams frying pans together for the sole purpose of being annoying ? Which leaves the viewer at home wondering : Is there anyone here playing the long game , insinuating him - or herself firmly into the household without drawing attention or suspicion ? Yes , there is one person who is doing that : Kevin . Early on , Kevin looked like that game-show staple : the Old Person No One Can Relate to So He s Shunned . At 56 , Kevin qualifies for Reality-TV Medicare and a drool cup . None of the others millennials all looks upon Kevin as a co-equal or a potential friend . He s the oldster , the dad ( he is , indeed , always ID d onscreen as Stay-at-Home Dad ) . When he first arrived , he played up his Boston accent and his working-class worldview , thereby establishing himself as an odd duck who was best ignored . Some hours of Big Brother passed without anyone directing a single remark to Kevin . Then Kevin found his groove , as a variation on a stereotype : He s become the cool dad , a nonthreatening paternal figure who attracts lost souls ( Ramses became a surrogate son , briefly ) and who does n t mind being the butt of jokes as long as they re affectionate jokes , not hostile or contemptuous ones ? Kevin benefits from a core of tough realism : He seems street-savvy , and his occasional direct addresses to the camera reveal a guy who is quietly ruthless , who knows damn well he could be thrown under the bus at any moment . So he does what aging tough guys do : He keeps his nose clean , assiduously avoids being a dirty old man in the context of a house that throbs with institutionalized hormonal craziness , and aligns himself with power discreetly . Thus far , Kevin has managed to cast votes that cut across party lines in a way that has yet to attract suspicion . And except for wrapping his abdomen with plastic-wrap at night to keep up his physical appearance ( remember his mantra : Cling-wrap at night/Will keep you tight ) , he has n t done anything so ostentatiously showy that the houseguests might say , Hey , what s up with the old dude ? He is , in the lingo of the game , a pawn , but a pawn with ambition : to go all the way . In this , Kevin is more like a character in a different Sunday-night show : Game of Thrones . He s the guy you do n t see slipping a shiv between your ribs until it s too late . Watch out , Paul : Some night while you sleep , you may have some plastic wrap placed over your face , smothering your chances of Big Brother domination .

		"paragraph": "Law enforcement lost one of its most famous members on Jan. 6 , when Dave Toschi a detective with the San Francisco Police Department passed away after a lengthy illness . Toschi was a brash , larger-than-life personality , even by the standards of his city , and he received his most famous assignment in 1969 when , alongside partner Bill Armstrong , he was tasked with handling the Zodiac serial-killer case . That , in turn , led to national prominence and attracted the attention of Hollywood , which soon used him as the template for two of its most memorable police-force protagonists and , eventually , immortalized him in one of the new millennium s best films . I m speaking , of course , about David Fincher s 2007 masterpiece Zodiac , in which Toschi is played by Mark Ruffalo . It s one of Ruffalo s finest performances , even if it sidesteps a less noble aspect of the man s official conduct ( which is noted in the Associated Press s obituary ) namely , that Toschi was removed from the never-solved Zodiac case in 1978 after confessing to writing anonymous letters that praised his work to the San Francisco Chronicle . Nonetheless , while that stunt got him into trouble with his superiors , it hardly mattered to Tinseltown , which twice used Toschi as inspiration for a go-for-broke cop : Steve McQueen s Bullitt ( 1968 ) and Clint Eastwood s Dirty Harry ( 1971 ) . For the former , McQueen actually shadowed Toschi as he worked , basing his character s fast-driving habits on the real-life sports car-loving detective . And though Eastwood reportedly did n t do likewise , his Dirty Harry tasked with hunting down a Zodiac-style killer was clearly modeled after Toschi as well . In fact , the connection between Toschi and Dirty Harry was outright underlined in Zodiac , when Ruffalo s Toschi is approached in a theater while watching the Eastwood film , at which point he states that they re already making movies about his life . As Ruffalo noted in an Instagram post Thursday , he too spent time with Toschi while shooting Zodiac , and developed an appreciation for his subject . The real Toschi later admitted to the Chronicle that although he enjoyed Fincher s film , it was n t easy for him to sit through it : I thought Ruffalo did a good job . I enjoy it , but it depresses me . After I watch it I get angry at myself because I could n t close the case . That inability to nab the Zodiac killer haunted him for the rest of his life resulting in ulcers , and compelling him to return to the scene of the crimes every year on their Oct. 11 anniversary . However , as evidenced by the three movies that came to life because of his career , his formidable Hollywood legacy remains an open-and-shut case . Read more from Yahoo Entertainment :",

		"paragraph": "Recently , my children began lobbying to watch a movie called Descendants . They d heard about it at their after-school program , where the soundtrack blared Did I mention that I m in love with you ? as the kids shot baskets and acted out the parts on the playground . I read up on it , quickly realizing I had a lot of catching up to do ( Descendants 2 left fans hanging in 2017 , and Descendants 3 was announced just recently with the exciting release of a trailer ) . It sounded like a clever enough idea : The children of various Disney villains Belle s adversary , Maleficent , and Snow White s nemesis , the Evil Queen , among them go to an exclusive boarding school with the children of the royals on whom those villains have preyed ( and , at first , conspire to take it over and let evil reign ) . Now , I m pretty well prepared to combat the princess media . I have had discussions with my daughters , 6 and 8 , about the limits of those royalty-rooted narratives , in which huge-eyed , tiny-waisted young women wealthy , beautiful , yet somehow powerless must be rescued by men . I knew , also , to teach them to recognize the whiteness of those worlds , and how heteronormative they were , with almost all straight and cisgendered characters . But I was not prepared for one consistent element of children s media something on full display in the endless stream of kids movies , from the Descendants franchise to the soon-to-be-released summer attractions Incredibles 2 , Show Dogs , and Transylvania 3 : Summer Vacation . And that , my friends , was romance . Much of Descendants , for example , centers on the budding love between Maleficent s daughter Mal and Sleeping Beauty s son Ben he even asks , Do you love me ? on the first date . ( Granted , he d been chowing on some love potion-laden chocolate chip cookies , but make no mistake , his love is real . ) To paraphrase my daughters when they see starry-eyed young boys and girls on the small or big screen about to kiss : Ewww . Boy-meets-girl is as old a narrative device as , say , Adam and Eve . Romance novels are a billion-dollar industry . Romance-fueled narratives are everywhere , but I have found myself increasingly agitated and confounded by their presence and prevalence in kids media . Still , I could n t quite put my finger on why , so I called a couple of experts to unpack it with me . The biggest problem with romance in kids media , says Sierra Filucci , executive editor of parenting content at Common Sense Media , a nonprofit that reviews children s media and technology , is that it is largely found in films and shows targeted at girls . If a female is the central character , most often there is a romantic storyline , Filucci says . Boy-oriented stories are full of action and adventure , of agency and independence . Girl-oriented stories are full of angsty ladies hoping to win the favor of boys , by way of primping and preening and passivity . The search for a man s affection or approval , says Rebecca Hains , a children s media culture expert and professor of media and communication at Salem State University , is presented as the be-all and end-all of life . All the other things we want for our girls mostly to have that action , adventure , agency , and independence that boys have take a back seat to the pursuit of romance . If the only story that is consistently being delivered to girls is that romance is wonderful and you should pursue it and make yourself appealing so you can have a heteronormative romance , well , what about all the parts of life that are very interesting ? asks Hains . There are so many aspects of life besides romance . It happens early and often , she says , that we essentially sell boys and girls on two different worlds , laying out gender-based norms that have very little rooting in reality . In general , boys and girls have so much more in common , Hains says . But our media reinforces the idea that boys and girls are different and sets children on pathways to imagine that there are many more differences than similarities . These kinds of messages can affect the way they think about themselves and the way they think about others . Hains notes that these messages do n t just get filtered into our kids brains they can help shape behavior , lifelong beliefs , and even public policy . What we come to believe is the natural normal order of things as children shapes our worldviews , and might have more influence on what we advocate for as adults , she says . Boys , for instance , may learn that they re not supposed to crave love and affection the way girls should . We have the idea that masculinity is not compatible with nurturing , she says , which , one could argue , affects both our cultural attitudes toward and our laws about things like paternity leave . Noting the number of hands-on dads , she says , It s so out of step with modern life . Meanwhile , women are still expected to place men and family first , no matter what they achieve emotional labor always takes precedence . Even if you have a great job and you re a scientist who invents robots , if you re a woman you re going to be responsible for all these other things , Hains says . If you re a great scientist but not a great mom , there s something wrong with you . This does n t mean you need to filter out all romantic storylines . It s impossible to put children in a bubble where they do n t see all those stories , says Filucci . I do n t think cutting them off from what their friends are experiencing is effective , because it can become this forbidden fruit . Certainly that was the case for this writer . The ban on soap operas in my house growing up precisely because my parents objected to how they promulgated the notion that love justifies everything only led to me sneaking General Hospital and surrendering my allowance to my older brother so he would n t tell . Instead , have a healthy media mix . It s not bad to show your kid a story that has some romance in it , but it s important to balance that with other stuff . Counterbalance those storylines and give them lots of nonstereotypical films , TV shows , and books , Filucci suggests . Certainly , there are many more choices than there used to be . Both Frozen and Maleficent , two Disney franchises , play to our romantic expectations by setting up a problem death , or the approximation of it that can be solved only with true love s kiss . But spoiler alerts in both movies , the male love interest is n t able to save the day the kiss has to come from someone who feels familial love . ( Meanwhile , speculation is rampant that Elsa may have a lesbian love interest in the upcoming Frozen sequel . ) Moana was blessedly romance-free , and the character of Rae in the new iterations of Star Wars is searching for her place in the universe , not a prince to rescue her . The role models are out there . And they re getting better . But there is work to do . Hains notes that , even in the female-centric Frozen , men have more than 50 percent of the dialogue . ( Not the case in Maleficent , though the men are largely incidental in that script . ) Talking , in fact , is the perfect antidote . Talk back at the screen with them . Talk about what s happening on the screen with them , Hains says . Make sure that your kids know you do n t necessarily agree that what s being presented is normal . No problem with that in this household I am regularly groaning during the romance scenes in Descendants . So it s good to know this is actually the prescription for creating mini media critics , and not just that I ca n t keep my mouth shut . And liking storylines beyond romance is , in fact , normal for females . These days , at least according to one study , women are far keener on action films than romantic comedies . Soap operas have all but vanished . It s up to us , the parents , to present them with these alternatives , to expand their definition of normal . It does take a little effort to seek out the alternative , says Filucci . But not that much more . Filucci says she s met many parents who complain about the princess problem , only to turn around and buy their kids a set of princess dolls for Christmas . You have more control than you think , she says . You just have to exert it . For our part , we re finishing up yet another screening of Descendants , replete with my objections , mini-lectures , and annotations . The kids love it anyway .

[ It s bracket time ! Sign up now to play Tourney Pick em ] It s an idea that s been applied in settings like the World Baseball Classic and even floated for the professional leagues , but MILB is now making it happen . Here s how the rule-change was explained : This is obviously not baseball tradition , but in a time where baseball tradition is getting re-examined every season , the idea does have supporters . Partially because we saw in the WBC that it makes extra innings much more exciting . Partially because teams would rather players not hurt in the minors than have a winning record . The hope is to expedite extra-innings games and not overuse pitchers especially because teams often have to play again the next day . Here s what MILB president Pat O Conner said about the change : [ Batter up : Join a Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for free today ] These are fair points and probably wo n t cause too much trouble at the minor-league level . However , that might not be what purists are most concerned about . Often times , the minor leagues are the test ground for new rules in Major League Baseball . The pitch clock , for instance , was introduced in the minor leagues first and has been flirted with at the big-league level . It was almost introduced this season and could be used next year . That s the bigger story here seeing whether this minor-league rule change is an experiment for Major League Baseball one day .

Click to see the 12 states getting hit hardest by Trump s tariffs . President Trump enacted a 10 percent tariff on $ 200 billion worth of Chinese goods in Sept. 2018 . This was the latest in a series of tariffs on imports , but the first one that meant prices on consumer goods will increase , in addition to impacting industrial product prices . Dollar Tree , which owns Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores , and other discount retailers like Dollar General heavily stock Chinese-made goods . About 42 percent of Dollar Tree products are imported , mostly from China , according to Telsey Advisory Group , a research and consulting firm . Family Dollar imports about 23 percent of its products .

		"paragraph": "Spoiler alert ! If you have n t watched this week s episode of Justified Collateral , written by Chris Provenzano and VJ Boyd and directed by Michael Pressman stop reading now . As he ll do throughout the season , showrunner Graham Yost takes us inside the writers room to break down key scenes and tease what s next . The series penultimate episode found Boyd putting two bullets into Constable Bob ( Patton Oswalt ) and surviving Zachariah s explosive suicide , Raylan and Boyd running into each other instead of Ava on the mountain , Ava being captured by the cops in Markham s pocket , Markham partnering with Loretta , and Vasquez issuing a BOLO for Raylan ( who was nabbed himself taking Bob to the hospital ) . Let s start with Boyd s final conversation with Hagan ( Shea Whigham ) in the truck . It feels like we ve been building to that talk all series : Boyd is like Harlan s Billy the Kid , and we all love a good outlaw story but the cold , hard truth is that sometimes outlaws do n t give a s t about you and may shoot you in the head . Is that how you view that moment?Yeah . That was part of the thinking behind it . Walton struggled mightily with this storyline and with that scene , but when we told him that we d cast Shea Whigham , he kind of melted and said , OK . Now it s going to work . He just loves Shea , and they ve known each other , I m sure , for years . Shea just brought a truth and a weight and a reality to it that just meshed well with where Boyd was and is . So it was a tough one . I think the way Pressman shot it was beautiful . Related : ‘ Justified Postmortem : Graham Yost Breaks Down that Epic Brawl in ' Fugitive Number One Do you think that s a moment where some fans could turn on Boyd , watching him kill a seemingly innocent man who s not involved at all in this world ? Whether or not the audience will turn on Boyd is a question . I think that this has just been part of the reality of Boyd for a long , long time . You know , there is that circular intent for the season , to bring things back to the way Boyd and Ava and Raylan to a degree originally were and restate that question . Heading into the final episode , there is a real question whether or not Raylan will kill Boyd , and he certainly has good reason to . Moving on to the Raylan-Boyd shootout in the woods , did you set it at night just so Raylan could have that awesome line about knowing it was Boyd because his teeth glow in the dark ? [ Laughs . ] You know , the history of that scene is funny . As we were breaking the episode , we realized Raylan s going to be coming down the mountain looking for Ava while Boyd is going up the mountain looking for Ava . We first thought , We ca n t really have a scene between them , can we ? Why do n t we just have them pass close by ? Then we realized we re missing a huge opportunity . Chris Provenzano really pushed for a big scene . We kidded him a lot , because I think the first draft of that sequence was eight pages long and included so many runs and jumps and just missing each other . Michael Pressman said , Chris , you get one near miss . Then the dialogue was hacked down to a degree , but it was still a lengthy scene . Leonard Chang , one of the writers , came up with this idea from Aristotle I believe it was in Poetics which is a scene of anagnorisis . It s also something that Shakespeare used in the tragedies where the hero , the villain , whoever usually the tragic hero has a moment of clarity , of realization of who they are and what s going on and what their flaw is . The scene is kind of that . It kind of morphed a little bit away from it , but in our short form in the room , we always called it the anagnorisis scene . We really wanted to go to the heart of Raylan s drive to kill Boyd , and Boyd pushing his buttons on that . So the acknowledgment that maybe Raylan ca n t get Boyd without becoming Boyd.Yes . Raylan s line , I crossed the line with my eyes wide open , is that he s perfectly aware of who he is and what he s doing . The teeth glow in the dark line was something that we d pitched almost as a joke in the room . It was sort of like , How does Raylan see Boyd ? And someone said , His teeth glow in the dark . Chris ended up using it , and it s a great line . At what point did you decide you needed to bring Bob back into the mix ? Did you need to give Raylan an out of that scene ? Fans would n t have been happy if he did n t go help him . That was partly it . We also just loved the idea of Bob stumbling into this whole thing and becoming collateral in a way of Raylan s adventures , or misadventures , as it were . Are you ready for trivia of trivia ? Related : ' Justified Director Jon Avnet Shares His Detailed Shot List for That Winnebago Battle Always.When you hear Bob yelling Help ! , did it sound like Bob ? It was distant , mixed down , and all sorts of effects on it and stuff , but we did n t have Patton doing that . We were doing the final playback of the episode where we go through all the sound and say , Bring up this helicopter sound , or Take it down , or Add this line , or Take it out , and we did n t have anything that worked . So that s me . That s me yelling , Help ! They set up a microphone on the mixing stage . I backed away from the mic and did a few takes . That is my one big moment of performance on this series , me yelling Help ! as Constable Bob . I love that . Was it always the idea to have Boyd shoot Bob off-screen then ? Because I think , again , that would have been tough for fans to watch.I mean , we talked about showing it , but the smart idea there was to stay with Ava , because Ava is the client of the show for the last three episodes , really . You re worried about what s going to happen to her . Are the bad guys going to get her ? So the idea of her knowing that it s Boyd , and Bob going to investigate , and her saying , No , Bob . Do n t go , and then hearing that [ while she s ] zip-tied to a handhold in the crappy Gremlin , and is she going to get free ? Thank God it s an old Gremlin and she can tear herself free . But just the idea of playing that terror off of her was a really strong choice . Anything else you can say about the Ava and Bob scene ? The whole idea of him trying to soothe her by saying there s an air freshener in the car that smells like a mocha latte … [ Laughs . ] I ca n t remember if that was scripted or if that was Patton . He has come up with some of the great lines for Bob . I mean , Stay frosty was his , back in Season 4 . Beef stew , when he did the whole thing about pulling his knife and stabbing someone . But there is a moment in there that just sort of , to me , exemplifies the greatness that is Patton Oswalt , which is this very , very funny line where he accuses Ava of trying to bribe him and all of that , and he says , And do n t try to seduce me . It s been tried . When we read that line , we laughed . It s very funny in the show , but the thing is that the laugh is truer and better because he just plays it straight . We saw Ava call someone when she was on the run.You re not supposed to know who she s calling . That s something we will find out in the finale ? Yes . To a degree . It will always remain somewhat of a mystery , but I think the audience will understand what happened . And when Markham s dirty cops caught her , Ava dropped Dewey s necklace out of her back pocket . So that will come back into play as well?Yes . Related : ' Justified Postmortem : Mary Steenburgen Talks About That RV Scene and the Katherine/Avery Love Story I also wanted to talk about that scene with Gutterson relaying Vasquez issuing a BOLO on Raylan to Art over the phone . It was kind of like the marshal version of a live tweet so funny . But Raylan getting caught at the end of the episode seems to suggest that we ll see more of Gutterson , Art , and Rachel in the finale . A certain amount . Certainly a lot of Art . Gutterson and Rachel , but sort of in a different context . And that s all I ll say . [ That scene ] was just fun . It was just something that evolved in terms of how incensed and how riled up Rick Gomez got playing Vasquez . I will say this , that s his last scene in the series . We all talked about it , that it was bringing it back around to how Vasquez was about Raylan at the beginning . He s just so furious , and Gutterson is just so cool and kind of funny about it . It s just the joy of working with Jacob [ Pitts ] , frankly . It s also Mel Fair as Nelson : You having a bad day , David ? It s one of his nicest moments in the series . Vasquez also has that scene with Wynn , when we get the nice tennis callback for Duffy with the Billie Jean King memorabilia being among his returned personal possessions . The big thing in that scene was we wanted to get to that moment where Vasquez asks him straight out , Who killed my boss ? We know that Duffy arranged it . Duffy just says , I honestly , truly do n t know . We knew that there would be a variety of things in the box . Now , you ca n t apparently say that something is a Billie Jean King autographed tennis ball unless you actually get an autographed Billie Jean King tennis ball with a certificate . You ca n t just fake that on a show , apparently . I did n t know that . So John Harrington , our head of props , sent away and got a Billie Jean King tennis ball and a certificate . That was real . Then as you see in the bus stop scene later , that tube of prescription toothpaste serves a purpose , as does the Eagle Scout knife . So we were planting those two things , but the Billie Jean King tennis ball was just kind of a fun bit . Related : ' Justified Star Joelle Carter Talks About Ava s Gunplay and Getaway , and Making Elmore Leonard Proud The whole idea of Wynn wanting a dog grooming van as his next mode of transportation is just perfect.Yeah , and there will be a payoff of that . Zachariah decided to wait at Grubes s place for Boyd and try to kill him . Was that the fate you always had in mind for Zachariah?He tried to blow up Boyd once before and that did n t work , and he tries again and sadly for his sake , it does n t work . I will tease that the presence of dynamite in that part of the story was important to us . The idea of him blowing himself up , we thought , was pretty cool . But the big thing was that in the manner of our series where we think we re going to kill someone off and then say , Wait a second , let s just keep him around . We might be able to use him we thought of Zachariah dying in [ Episode ] 9 when he tries to blow up Boyd . Then we saw that there could be something else pretty cool for him , and there is an echo of Zachariah in the final episode . That s all I ll say about that . Loretta had some great scenes in this episode . RIP , Derek ( Riley Bodenstab ) . We just liked the idea of Loretta s in a jam , she s hiding out , she s bought the Bennett property so she s got all their drying sheds and homes and all of that . Hiding out in that old drying shed was a cool place to have her be . We liked the idea of bringing in Derek , who had been her quasi boyfriend back in Season 5 . He makes the mistake of taking the job , because he goes up against Boone and Jenny . That conversation between Markham and Loretta I love how close they were sitting and that Kaitlyn Dever totally holds her own up against Sam Elliott . What did you want to accomplish with that moment?Without teasing or spoiling anything in the final episode , we were breaking the two of them kind of together at the same time , to a degree , so we would go back and forth of where we needed Loretta to be in the final episode and therefore where we d have her in the 12th . Really , the crux of it was Markham saying , I see some of Katherine in you , and even more than that , some of Mags in you . There she is , she could be killed , and she talks her way out of it , and we just thought that was a great thing for Loretta to be able to do . If felt like you needed that earlier scene of Markham talking to Katherine s body , to explain that he wanted to kill Duffy but he was going after the money first.Yes . You hear it so many times everyone always says , Where is the goddamn money ? I ve got to get the goddamn money that that s what the money is called . It s the goddamn money . You know , that s unintentional , but I think there is something to it , which is that the money , to a degree , is cursed . That money has been damned . All of the trouble that has unfolded over this entire season is people s quest to get or defend that money . That scene in the morgue , first of all , thanks so much to Mary [ Steenburgen ] for coming back to spend a few hours lying there on the stage to do that scene . In the gag reel , they do have her waking up and looking at the camera going , Wait , there s money ? It was just Pressman directing and Sam performing it it s really a wonderful scene . Related : ' Justified Postmortem : Graham Yost Breaks Down the Shocking Ending of ' Trust One of the sad things about this episode is our great composer , Steve Porcaro , his brother passed away while we were in post on this episode . He had had a long , long struggle with ALS , so Steve could n t do the music for this episode . Mark Bonilla wrote most of the music for this episode . Mark wrote the cue for that morgue scene . It was just a beautiful piece of work . One of the interesting things about this episode was how much work we ended up doing in [ post ] . It s a mad , headlong rush at that point [ in the season ] to write the scripts and get them shot . You wish that we d been able to plan and plan and get stuff written far ahead , and it s the end of the series , and let s have everything nailed down . It s like nope , this is a television series and we are running for the finish line . There was a great deal of work we did in post structurally , moving scenes around , and that [ morgue ] scene was a scene that could move . It was originally supposed to be before the credits and the teaser , and we moved it later because we wanted to get things really moving for Raylan by the end of the teaser , having him leave Cope and head up into the hills . Raylan signing over Arlo s home to Cope ( Tom E. Proctor ) and the hill people seemed like him making his intent clear : He s leaving Kentucky . He wants to be gone . We talked about Raylan encountering Cope and the hill people one more time in the series . This sort of came to us , that this could be an obstacle for him trying to get up the mountain . It was the notion that times have even changed for the hill people , that they ca n t just stay up where they ve been for generations , that they re going to have to move , that things have shifted . Then the idea going back to the sort of origin story of Arlo , and Bo , and Drew Thompson , and the drugs that came down from the sky and all of that that Arlo had been instrumental , and it sort of started his empire , as it were . That it came back to the hill people , which related to Raylan s mother , Frances . We just liked the circularity of that . The notion of him signing over the property really landed well with all of us . Also , Raylan states that was one of his many excuses for not leaving , and now he s just giving it up .

		"paragraph": "More details are emerging about the night Demi Lovato apparently overdosed in late July . In a new report , TMZ cites sources who allege that the singer took Oxycodone laced with fentanyl . ( The reports have not been confirmed . ) The TMZ report states that Lovato called a drug dealer to her home around 4 a.m. , and they freebased Oxycodone on aluminum foil . The dealer who apparently laced the drugs with fentanyl is believed to have left Lovato s home when he noticed she was in bed , breathing heavily . Lovato was later administered Narcan , a drug that can treat a narcotic overdose in an emergency situation . Whether the 25-year-old freebased or not remains to be seen . But either way , the practice is highly dangerous . Although freebasing is n t a term that s used a lot in pop culture , it s fairly common when it comes to drug abuse , Jamie Alan , PhD , an assistant professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Michigan State University , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . Usually , the drugs you buy at a pharmacy are mixed with sodium , she explains . A certain amount of the medication is the active drug and a certain amount is a salt , Alan says . When people freebase , they remove the salt and extract just the pure form of the drug , Alan says . Often people will take that pure form , heat it ( usually on foil ) , and inhale the vapors , addiction specialist Neeraj Gandotra , MD , chief medical officer at Delphi Behavioral HealthGroup , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . There are a few major reasons this is so dangerous : One is that a person is ingesting more active drug per weight , which can increase the odds of an overdose , Alan says . The other is that smoking a drug can cause a fast high , Gandotra says , and that can lead to someone taking in even more than if it was taken in another form . Not only that , smoking or snorting a drug bypasses your liver , which will help filter out some of the drug before it reaches the rest of your body if you took it orally , Alan says as a result , it s more likely that a person will overdose . As for taking a drug that s laced with fentanyl , that s especially bad , Alan says . Both fentanyl and Oxycodone are opioids , and putting the two together will have an even more addictive effect , she says . Fentanyl is also one of the most potent opioids on the market , and if someone does n t have a tolerance to it , that person can rapidly go into respiratory distress and arrest , Alan says . Lovato reportedly spent two weeks in the hospital and is currently seeking treatment for drug addiction . Her representatives have yet to comment on TMZ s allegations .

		"paragraph": "Warning : This story contains spoilers for the second episode of Outlander Season 2 . The biggest star of tonight s episode of Outlander did n t have a single line of dialogue , but nevertheless spoke volumes . We re talking , of course , about the red dress that Claire ( Caitriona Balfe ) wears to King Louis XV s royal ball at Versailles , a stunning gown with a plunging neckline that also causes Jamie Fraser s ( Sam Heughan ) jaw to plunge . Fans have been longing to see this particular dress modeled in three dimensions since author Diana Gabaldon first described it in detail in the second Outlander novel , 1992 s Dragonfly in Amber . And the show s costume designer , Terry Dresbach , went into Season 2 knowing she had to make their two-decade wait worth it . Related : ‘ Outlander Premiere Postmortem : Yes , Diana Gabaldon Was in Support of That Season 2 Premiere Twist Ron [ Moore , Outlander s showrunner ] was like , ‘ You do n t have to do it red . We could make it some other color , Dresbach tells Yahoo TV in this new video interview . And I m like , ‘ You must do the red dress ! They ll come and burn us at the stake if you do n t . ( That would be a particularly unfortunate ending for the pair , since Moore and Dresbach are married and raising two children off-screen . ) With the decision already made for her , Dresbach set about creating what she describes as a very tricky costume . Among the factors she had to take into account were the discrepancies between the actual 18th century French gowns she researched and the dress that Gabaldon invented in print , as well as finding a shade of red that would dazzle the eye without being too intense on film . Dresbach says that she took her inspiration from the 1940s rather than the 1740s , since that s the time period the show s time-traveling heroine hails from . More importantly , she made a point to keep the dress itself simple , even if the design process was n t . When you re dressing someone like Caitriona Balfe , you do n t have to go overboard , she says . You just sort of need to frame her and that s what we tried to do . Related : ' Outlander Review : We re Not in Scotland Anymore For her part , Balfe tells Yahoo TV that she needed slightly more assistance with her #RedDress moment beyond being properly framed . It was a big dress 4-feet wide she remembers . I had to perfect the art of walking sideways . It s a work of art , but it was n t the easiest piece to wear . Dresbach confirms that the red dress , like so many of this season s outfits , demanded a lot of maneuvering : We had many , many test runs , because the actresses ca n t get through the trailer doors ! But none of that awkwardness is evident that first time Claire appears in that red dress , descending the stairs where her husband stands , his mouth agape . I had seen Cat moments before that shot , sort of crab-walking down the corridor , Heughan says with a laugh . The dress was so wide that she could n t get through the door ! But in that moment on the stairs , she looks spectacular . You do n t have to act too much when you see her wearing that dress . Outlander airs Saturdays at 9 p.m. on Starz .",

Financial records seized in the investigation detail cash advances and benefits allegedly given to players and their families . The documents revealed a $ 1,400 payment listed next to Pope s name for his sophomore season at San Diego State , where he was garnering some interest as a potential NBA draft pick . It is unclear whether Pope received the payment . The university is currently conducting an internal investigation . And you can be sure this only the first shoe to drop as a result of the scandal .

		"paragraph": "Warning : This recap for the season finale of The Bachelorette contains spoilers . Well , rose lovers , we and our beloved bachelorette have made it to the end of this journey . As for the happiness of the aforementioned ending … well , I think by now we ve all learned to reserve judgment on that until at least six to eight months after the finale . But before we can get to the proposal , first we must go to the Tealight Candle Thunderdome , where Chris Harrison and Team Bachelorette have compelled Rachel to sit on the stage and live-blog her own finale for our viewing pleasure . Can I leave ? asks the Bachelorette , not joking at all . Sorry , toots , but you re stuck with us . Now let s go back even further two weeks , to be exact , to Rachel and Peter s emotional impasse in Rioja , Spain . In the next , basically , week at this point , what if I m not ready to say , ‘ Will you marry me ? Peter asks the tearful Bachelorette . She has no ready answer other than , I m trying not to cry . Rachel needs a relationship that she knows will move past the girlfriend-boyfriend stage , and it does not look as though Peter will be able to give it to her . Still , Peter urges Rachel not to let the focus on a televised proposal scuttle their relationship , which he says is worth pursing . It s a nice , reasonable sentiment , but nice and reasonable are not at all what Team Bachelorette wants at this point and they ve successfully impressed their desires upon Rachel . So what is she going to do ? Give him the Fantasy Suite card , of course ! After all , Rachel says she and Peter have a lot that we have to talk about , and what better place to do it than a luxury , camera-rree zone that also has room service ? The Bachelorette is hopeful . Maybe there will be clarity in the morning , she says . I ll say : That s about as clear as things are gon na get , gurl . I really feel like the time that Peter and I spent alone made our relationship better , says Rachel . But we re still on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to a proposal . Make up your mind , girl ! It s time for the rose ceremony . … Wait , what s this ? Omg , I forgot we still have to get through Bryan s overnight date ! This season s time-shifting shenanigans have me all kinds of turned around . [ Heavy sigh . ] All right , let s just get this over with . Rachel and Bryan ride on horseback through the vineyard to a rustic outdoor bar , where they stop for some wine and a strained conversation . Let s listen in : Rachel is clearly distracted , mainly because Peter messed with [ her ] mind and now she does n t have a clear handle on which guy to send packing at the rose ceremony . Over dinner , Bryan admits that their date felt a little off , because he felt a different energy than Rachel but the Bachelorette apologizes and assures him that her spacey energy does n t have anything to do with him . All right you crazy kids , off to the Fantasy Suite you go . We re back on track . The chemistry is hotter than ever , Bryan announces . Any doubts we had about each other were all answered last night . Okay , okay , okay . Now can we get to the final rose ceremony , please ? The windup is all about how Rachel knows she wants a proposal at the end , how she knows Peter might not give it to her , and how she has to just follow her heart , and so that means the last man to be sent to the Reject SUV is . … Though Eric was ready to propose , Rachel says she does n t personally feel like he s ready for marriage . By contrast , Peter is ready for marriage … he s just not yet ready to propose and for now , I guess , that seems like a better option B to Rachel . On the Bye-Bye Bench , Rachel gives Eric the I love you , but I m not in love with you speech , and his response is pure class . I just want to say thank you for being open , for allowing me to be open . … Thank you for allowing me to get what I need , and God willing , I promise you , I know you re going to get what you want , says Eric . And truth be told , I will always love you . As Rachel puts it , No bitterness , no hate , no regrets . And that s why Eric is such an amazing and beautiful person . Just a thought . After sending Eric home , Team Bachelorette embracing the let s make this the Before , During , and After the Final Rose concept brings Eric on stage to reunite with Rachel and discuss their breakup . What could have been a tense encounter is once again completely cordial , as Eric remains gentlemanly and mature about the situation . You had to do it , he tells Rachel , asking her whether she s happy . Of course she says yes , and turns the question around to him . Eric assures her that he s phenomenal and Rachel is n t kidding when she says , You look phenomenal ! Just look at him : Back to the show : Now that we re down to the final two , both Bryan and Peter know that Peter is the underdog . When Rachel said she wants a proposal , she looked directly in my eyes , admits Peter . Why ca n t I be ready right now to propose to this woman ? Fortunately for Peter , he still has the Last Chance Date … which is literally the last date , too , because Bryan is up first . If I had a ring , I would propose to Rachel right now , Bryan reminds us . He and Rachel cuddle and smooch as they float over the gorgeous Spanish countryside in a hot air balloon a vista that is made slightly less gorgeous by the sight of Bryan repeatedly jabbing his tongue into Rachel s mouth . Once back on the ground , the Bachelorette tells us that her mind is not yet made up . Perhaps sensing this , Bryan re-ups his sales pitch . To be honest , I think it would be a mistake if you did n t choose me , he says . I would be devastated . I would be the most heartbroken I ve ever been in my life if I lost you . And she loves it . When it comes time for the traditional last date hotel gift shop offering , Bryan gives Rachel a homemade Spanish dictionary , with personalized phrases such as husband , wife , forever , and leap of faith . Can Peter top that ? Let s find out . The color-coordinated couple meets outside the beautiful Monasterio de Valvanera , where they stroll the sacred grounds and explore the church and its statuary . Inside they meet a kindly monk , who inquires if they are promised as a couple . They respond with some mumbled maybes , so the holy man goes on to remind them that couples should n t get bogged down in little things that are not important like , say , demanding that your engagement meet a reality show s accelerated timeline . ( Okay , I m paraphrasing that last part . ) Still , Peter knows he s not ready to propose but he s also not ready to lose Rachel , either . Honestly , Peter does n t have a good answer other than he did n t really expect to fall for the Bachelorette when he signed up to be on The Bachelorette . Peter reiterates that he only wants to get engaged once in his life , etc. and he sure does n t sound convinced that he ll be able to make a decision in 24 hours . It s like , I m forcing something to happen , and you just do n t want me in that way , sighs our sad Bachelorette . I m so confused as to how you can see forever with me , but you ca n t do the step that you have to get to forever . I do n t get it . Neither do I , TBH . Peter wants to settle down and go to football games and the farmers market and wine night with painting with Rachel . Even Peter s mom said he would be comfortable having children with his partner before he d feel comfortable getting married . In short : Peter , what is your deal ? It s the same question Rachel s been asking herself all along and by the time night rolls around , she finally gets her answer . I am in love with you , Peter says . But I do n t feel that I am ready to ask you to marry me tomorrow . I do n t want to stop being with you . … Sorry , pal , but Rachel stopped listening right around tomorrow . If I agree to date you … what guarantee do I have that it s ever going to leave that stage ? she says , wiping away tears . Because my past has shown that it wo n t . Peter promises that he s going to try like , really hard to make it work , but he simply wo n t be browbeaten into proposing , even if it means losing her . In other words , he is behaving like a rational human being but there s no place for that kind of behavior on The Bachelorette . Go , Peter , go ! I m not so much annoyed at Rachel for pushing him as I am proud of Peter for pushing back against the absurdities of this show . Yes , he went on the show knowing what it was , but why do producers need to insist that everyone fall in love the same way ? Anyhow , Rachel replies with an exasperated , I ca n t answer that question , and again our favorite couple is at an impasse . And now Peter and Rachel are n t just sad they re angry at each other , and at the situation . Peter tensely suggests he will make a sacrifice and propose if she gives him a chance , simply to prove to her how important she is to him but Rachel wants a coerced proposal about as much as Peter wants to make one . Then there s no other choice ! Peter snaps . Then we just have to split , right here and now . They go around and around like this for a while longer , and continue to end up right back where they started : Rachel : If you do n t want to , do n t do it . Peter : But losing you hurts more . The Bachelorette , rightfully , worries that Peter would one day be resentful if he were essentially forced to propose on TV and Peter , rightfully , says he ca n t promise he would n t feel that way . I will give you an amazing life and an amazing relationship , Peter tells her , even if he does n t propose the next day . It s a big promise to make but not as big as the promise Bryan said he was ready to make on , like , day four . And Peter s promise is n t big enough for Rachel . I ca n t do tomorrow and you tell me you just want to be my boyfriend , she says . Oof . Does anyone else s heart hurt right now ? If you change your mind , murmurs Peter , you know where you can find me . Ever the gentleman , a sniffling Peter helps Rachel with her coat and leads her to the elevator , where they share a long , sad hug and an even sadder kiss goodbye . I love you , Rachel , whispers Peter . Take a chance , urges Peter , but Rachel is so terrified of ending up in an endless emotional holding pattern that she forces herself to say goodbye and walk away leaving both of them miserable . As if watching that breakup was n t brutal enough I cried my eyelashes off , Rachel tells us we now have to watch an emotional Peter come out and see the Bachelorette for the first time … having just watched their tear-jerking goodbye from backstage . It was incredibly difficult , says Peter of watching the scene . I m shaking like a leaf right now . Though he does n t actually think something was wrong with him or his relationship with Rachel Peter does still regret not being able to feel comfortable about proposing just to meet the show s timetable . I watched you walk out the door and I knew that you were a person I could spend the rest of my life with , he tells Rachel . And I let you go because I could n t get to that same point when I needed to . Peter does regret saying Rachel would have a mediocre life with Bryan and Rachel assures him that she s living her best life . There s clearly a lot of emotion and feeling between these two Peter feels attacked by Rachel here in the Tealight Candle Thunderdome , while Rachel says she s just frustrated with the man who was almost her fianc . I did n t feel like you knew what you wanted , says Rachel . Though she applauds him for being true to himself , she s probably still a wee bit annoyed that he signed up for The Bachelorette in the first place . I just do n t think that this world , this process , this show I just do n t think that it s for you , she says . They part with a sad hug , and then it s time for a commercial break . And when we get back from the break , Rachel is back on track though she does admit that her conversation with Peter made me question if I m rushing into this with Bryan . ( I think we can answer that for you , honey : yes . ) I just wonder if it s too much of a turnaround from last night to be in the right headspace for today . ( Again , allow us to chime in : yes . ) While Rachel just does n t know whether she s ready to accept a proposal after having her heart ripped out the night before , Bryan is champing at the bit to put this diamond monolith on the Bachelorette s finger . Given that we only have about 10 minutes left before After the Final Rose , something tells me Rachel s gon na manage to get her proposal headspace right and quick . And yes , by the time Bryan meets Rachel at the top of the ( very ) windy hilltop , she is ready to hear his ardent declaration of love how their first kiss was like a chemistry bomb going off . How she s everything he wants in a woman , a wife , the mother of my children . When it comes her turn to speak , Rachel gives Bryan what sounds like ( though was clearly not meant to be ) a somewhat backhanded compliment in the past , she s gone for the excitement of complicated relationships . But now , she s going with Bryan : Right here , in this moment , standing with you , I see my forever . So you know what happens next : Yes ! Give it to me ! demands our Bachelorette no more . ( If you listen really hard , you can hear the sound of Bryan s mom s sobs , carried all the way from Miami by the wind . ) And we re now at the Tealight Candle Thunderdome ! For whatever reason , Bryan feels the need to propose to Rachel again . ( Maybe he knows everyone was rooting for Peter ? ) Either way , the Bachelorette no more is glowing . It feels good to have him with me and by my side ! gushes Rachel . Harrison asks about the day of the proposal , and Bryan says he had blind faith that his love would be reciprocated , and it was . ( Yay ? ) As for their future , Harrison presses them for details , but Rachel insists they re not rushing anything , and they re just trying to build their lives together in a normal sense . ( Oh honey , that ship has sailed . ) For now , Rachel and Bryan say their future consists of living a normal life getting coffee , walking Copper , begging their families to accept that this is really happening , etc . So … good luck , you two . Bryan may not be the guy that I ( or a whole lot of Bachelorette viewers ) wanted Rachel to end up with , but I hope it works out for her . ( And when it does n t , I hope she finds a nice guy in the real world and lives happily ever after . ) Speaking of things that are unfortunate , the night end with an extended season preview of Bachelor in Paradise notable only because it ( partially ) reveals how the show will deal with the production shutdown : By making it part of the storyline , of course ! But that s a recap for another week . For now , rose lovers , tell me what you think of tonight s Bachelorette finale : Did Rachel make the right choice , or will she regret sending Peter packing ? Should Peter be the next Bachelor , or should it be Eric ? ( Or someone else ? ) Post your thoughts now ! And stay tuned for Chris Harrison s behind-the-scenes blog , coming tomorrow . Now , if you ll excuse me , I m going to sleep for a week . Bachelor in Paradise premieres Monday , August 14 at 8 p.m. on ABC . Read more from Yahoo TV :",

		"paragraph": "Washington ( AFP ) - Friday morning at 5:42 am ( 0942 GMT ) , a rocket owned by the US company SpaceX will blast off from Florida carrying two and a half tons of gear from NASA , only to dock three days later and 250 miles ( 400 kilometers ) above Earth at the International Space Station . The rocket itself is not new . It launched a NASA satellite into orbit two months ago , then landed back on Earth -- upright -- on a barge in the Atlantic Ocean off Cape Canaveral . Even the Dragon capsule , carrying the cargo and affixed to the top of the rocket , was used before . It flew a mission to the ISS in 2016 . These missions may appear routine , but they represent a revolution in space travel . Friday 's flight will be the 15th SpaceX mission for the US space agency since 2012 , one of which exploded in flight . Another company , Orbital ATK , has completed nine supply trips , with one explosion as well . Before SpaceX , only national governments resupplied the space station . Today , NASA is so dependent on the private sector that the US space agency has signed contracts with SpaceX and Boeing to send astronauts to space beginning next year , as soon as their capsules are ready . NASA has been unable to send people to space since the space shuttle program ended in 2011 . Instead , the world 's space agencies buy seats aboard Russia 's Soyuz spaceships , which launch from Baikonur , Kazakhstan . \" The combination of government and private sector activity is unrivaled , \" said John Logsdon , professor emeritus of political science and international affairs at George Washington University . - American resurgence - SpaceX , founded by Tesla CEO and space enthusiast Elon Musk , has shaken up the satellite launch sector , with more than 55 launches of its Falcon 9 rocket since 2010 . Thanks to SpaceX , the United States has taken the global lead in launches once again , after losing ground for more than a decade to Russia and China . \" The Russians have certainly been one of the countries that have had the greatest loss in terms of launch market share , \" said Tom Stroup , president of the Satellite Industry Association . The number of satellite launches is expected to surge in the coming years . Never before has low-Earth orbit been so accessible . Miniature satellites weighing a few pounds ( kilograms ) can be made quickly and launched for tens of thousands of dollars . These CubeSats made up 292 of the 345 satellites launched in 2017 , according to the Satellite Industry Association . \" They are almost disposable , \" said Claude Rousseau of Northern Sky Research , explaining that their operational life expectancy is three to seven years and they can be easily replaced . In the coming months , SpaceX and the startup OneWeb want to send into orbit constellations of hundreds of small satellites that will provide internet access . Competition is fierce in the Earth observation market , with multiple companies at work on constellations to offer military or civilian clients high resolution imagery of infrastructure , farming areas and military installations . To meet the demands of the small satellite market , companies are working on smaller rockets . One , made by the US venture Rocket Lab , had been due to try its first commercial launch from New Zealand on Wednesday , but the mission was put on hold . China and India , whose space programs are mainly backed by public funds , also aim to boost market share . China has already launched more rockets this year than it did in all of 2017 , according to Northern Sky Research . - Tourism , Moon and Mars - The age of space tourism is also approaching . Virgin Galactic is ramping up tests for its piloted SpaceShipTwo VSS Unity , which is launched from an airplane . A seat will cost $ 250,000 . And Blue Origin , founded by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos , will sell tickets next year for a seat on its New Shepard spacecraft , which is designed to carry six people into space . These two vehicles will not go into orbit around Earth , but will allow passengers to experience spaceflight and weightlessness for several minutes before returning to Earth . Finally , NASA is working on a space station that would orbit the Moon , as a stepping off point for missions to Mars in the coming decades . NASA is building the Orion capsule and Space Launch System ( SLS ) rocket to send people around the Moon for the first time since 1972 . The SLS will be the most powerful rocket ever built by the United States . Its first lunar orbit mission is planned for 2020 , with astronauts on board by 2023 .",

		"paragraph": "Over the weekend , I entered the word how into my browser , and the top searches auto-populated as below : ( Not going to admit what I was actually searching ! ) Clearly , the Latin lover is highly desirable . As one myself , I can attest to that . So why have I never given it a try ? Let s get simple facts out of the way first . I was raised in a predominately white town the only Latinos I saw were my family members . So sheer numbers ( i.e. , lack of opportunity ) played an important role . The reason for not dating them after leaving said town at 18 years old is a stickier subject . The psychology behind my subconscious strategy began early , as all our most limiting narratives do . I remember playing on the playground in kindergarten with Michael Allen , my very first crush . Michael was adorable blue-eyed and towheaded . I was head-over-baby-heels ! He seemed to return my feelings until one day he asked me , Are you black ? and ran away . I had no idea what this meant at the time , except that I was clearly different , and it seemed the difference ( according to him ) was a negative one . Call me crazy , but that kind of stuck ! And the trauma was reinforced as it repeated throughout grammar , middle , and high school in various circumstances and intensified degrees . Chief among them was my relationship with my very first boyfriend , Brett . I was 17 years old my parents were splitting up my sister , the closest person in my life , had gone away to college and I was being bullied at school in a big way . I was feeling isolated and scared when I found myself in detention ( for being persistently tardy ) , and there he was . Brett had expressed interest in me for many years , but I never returned the feelings . Until now . Simultaneously , demographics were changing in town . At this time , the area experienced a surge of Latino immigrants looking for work in the affluent town . They found it readily at the strip mall , various local restaurants , and in childcare and landscaping . As immigration became more prevalent , so did the resistance to it . Our new residents were different in a particular way they were brown , which was the easiest thing to identify and , in turn , attach prejudices to . In school , the term dirty Mexican became a very common insult , and the link to me was made immediately . Not only did I look like these immigrants , but I spoke the language and lived on the very edge of town , Selma Boulevard , a street known to offer more affordable housing . I was suddenly viewed as different from the same kids I d grown up alongside since pre-K . It felt as if they had suddenly discovered a dirty little secret about me . ‘ Now they understood . And while I would go after any peer who made a disparaging or racist remark , I submissively swallowed my boyfriend s and his family s racism daily . The racism was subtle at first , but progressed as it became clear my relationship with Brett could be more than just a high school crush . I can recall Brett s dad , Robert , bragging to us one day that he had picked up a local Mexican in town and given him a pitiful amount of money to manicure their incredibly extensive property . He stared curiously for my reaction . My father was a tree surgeon , a fact Robert knew , and often took jobs on the weekends , such as the one he was describing to us . I felt rage at Robert , at myself but I was frozen . I felt like a mouse in a cage . I knew I should run , but something made me feel as if I should prove my worth to this depraved family . Something about their degrading treatment felt familiar to me , and so I stayed . But the family s objection to the relationship never ceased , and I was eventually forbidden to visit the house . Brett did not break up with me though . Our hormonal codependency was enough to sustain the persistent attacks from his family and even our peers . The reaction to our coupling in school was that I was a gold digger . I m at a loss for a response there , even after 15 years . Meanwhile , Brett was unfazed . He seemed to congratulate himself on his exotic tastes in the same way he did his horribly ostentatious cars . ( He drove a white Hummer and a black Corvette that you could hear coming from the moon , approximately 1.2 miles to school every day . ) I was n t sure what to make of this , but I felt safer having him on my side . It touched me that he stood up to his parents , and I felt insulated from the bullies at school even though he was the biggest bully of all . To me Brett , his family , and my peers confirmed the complejo ( the Spanish word for complex ) that began that day in kindergarten with Michael Allen . And while we all have those coming-of-age experiences where we feel we do not fit in , mine was attached to my ethnicity , the color of my skin , my unique features , and the people I love most my family . The experience was quite painful and birthed in me a cover-up hiding aspects of my personality I felt could isolate me from my white peers and a constant seeking of approval from white men ( and white women really ) . Their stamp of approval was the hall pass I needed . Water me down with your whiteness , my subconscious cried . And I was willing to be eroticized for my spiciness ( Brett literally called me spicy as a compliment ) if it meant he could help me blend in . I realized I wanted Brett s love ( i.e. , his choosing to be in a relationship with me over the white girls ) to prove I was attractive and desirable that even if I was different , I was still OK . And as long as he did n t run away ( the way Michael Allen did ) , even if the relationship was torture , it meant I was lovable despite my brownness . A white man choosing a brown girl was the ultimate approval , and therefore my subconscious goal into adulthood . Even after moving away from small towns and small minds , I could feel the trigger activated most especially in my love life . As anyone could predict , my issues manifested as follows : I ve clocked a solid 18 years in long-term relationships . Four boyfriends all white men and two from my hometown . ( Yup , I m a glutton for punishment ! ) I recently became aware of my pattern when my most recent crush stopped me dead in my tracks . I first met him , let s call him Bill , in a job interview where he barely looked at or spoke to me . In spite of that , Bill soon became my boss . He was blue-eyed and towheaded . Sound familiar ? We became fast friends and developed a trustworthy business relationship . I believed him to be a great guy , which he is . I d invent reasons to speak to Bill in order to suss out why he was clearly going to be my future husband . Conveniently the most terrifying political election in history was going down , but he had no interest in discussing . He lived blocks from the Trump building and yet was somehow completely oblivious to the historic Women s March . In fact , he told me that while he understood his position of privilege as a white man , people s passionate views on today s tumultuous climate made him highly uncomfortable , and he preferred not to engage . Meanwhile , I was visibly crying at the office the day Trump was elected and proudly shouting LOVE TRUMPS HATE whilst wielding a Planned Parenthood sign at the march . I was turned off by his entitled apathy , but with my historic trigger activated , I had to make my fantasy about Bill a reality in order to feel OK . It was the first time I became aware of what I was doing . Bill was simply being himself and a savvy businessman , which is not wrong . But I was deciding I liked him based not on what was actually being presented but on what I subconsciously needed , which was to have this white man approve of me by agreeing with my politics . If he agreed , then I would obvs marry him . Duh . The truth is : Sure , he was handsome , driven , and polite , but it was clear our core values did not resonate . I dreaded my crush on that day and was proud of myself for making major progress . Today I m dating . I m aware of my subconscious patterning , and I can see when I move toward old habits . When I do , I try to remind myself that was then and this is now . I was a little girl trying to fit in , and I did n t know any better . But I ve always been a ferociously proud Latina . I honor my heritage and my parents heroic stories of overcoming great odds to achieve the American dream . I love my unique features being bilingual and I want to continue those traditions with my own family one day . Does this mean I must finally find my Latin lover ? I do n t know . But I m more open than ever . I never felt my pattern caused me to turn away from Latin men . It just kept me on a hamster wheel using one archetype as a tool for self-harm cementing an insecurity from my childhood . And now I can move toward a man , of any race or ethnicity , who embraces all of me .

It was in the comments section on a recent selfie that Jenner let fans know that she 's \" got rid of all \" her hyaluronic acid lip fillers . She was replying to a fan comment wondering why \" she looks like the old Kylie here . \" It turns out that giving birth to Stormi was a major factor that influenced her decision to stop getting fillers . Despite the fact that Kylie is a master of branding and has made an almost billion-dollar business off her lips and cosmetics , once Stormi was born , Kylie realized she was a mother first , and that is a big reason she has been sporting the more natural look , \" a source told Entertainment Tonight . \" Kylie is a master of branding , and she plays with the concept of mother-the more natural look-and her Kylie Cosmetics look , full glam . \" Some fans have even speculated that Jenner is moving toward a more natural lip look so that her business can branch beyond the Kylie Cosmetics Lip Kit . That 's silly , of course , seeing as the company has launched Kylighters , eyeshadow palettes , blushes , concealers , and more-and is on track to be a billion dollar company by the time Jenner turns 21 .

		"paragraph": "Patrick Cantlay has sparked outrage at the PGA Championship all because of something he did before hitting the ball . The 26-year-old American has come under fire for an agonisingly long pre-shot routine . His slow-going was particularly evident at the Par 3 sixth hole during Thursday s opening round at the Bellerive Country Club . Cantlay took a staggering 22 looks at the flag before finally hitting , taking 40 seconds from when he first addressed the ball . Astonished commentators started counting the number of times Cantlay looked from the ball to the flag , snapping as the mark hit 22 . You ca n t get to 22 , one said . We re having some fun with it but that is honestly that s a disgrace . As it turns out , the routine did n t even prove fruitful Cantlay overshot the green and landed in the bunker , making a bogey . Fans were also infuriated by the delay . Jason Day fought back tears after the opening round of the PGA Championship , when he spoke with a heavy heart about the loss of his good friend Jarrod Lyle . It s hard because you sit there and you know him and he s a buddy of yours , and he s not there anymore , Day said . He s never going to come back . That s the hardest thing to sort of come by . Now I m tearing up . Many players teed off with a heavy heart after learning Lyle lost his battle with leukemia at age 36 . The Australian was diagnosed twice with blood cancer as a youth and twice thought he had beaten it only to have it return last year . I ve known Jarrod a long time , fellow Aussie Day said . I lived across the street from him when we first started out in Orlando . He s a good buddy of mine . It s obviously heartbreaking to see . In recalling Lyle s life , 2015 PGA winner Day noted his friend s determination to make the most of life , fighting to enjoy every possible day . He battled half his life . And the crazy thing is he was always upbeat and positive , Day said . Rickie Fowler , who fired a five-under-par 65 to take the lead , wore yellow in honour of Lyle . I was scripted to wear a dark blue shirt , so luckily I had a version of yellowish and I m happy ( I ) could support Jarrod , Fowler said . It was tough news yesterday and it s been a tough few weeks . with agenies",

		"paragraph": "The list of accusations against R. Kelly is so long , it took a 19-minute song to address them . The controversial singer , who has been accused of running a sex cult and holding women against their will at his Chicago and Atlanta homes , tackles the topic and then some in a new , very long song called I Admit , which he previewed on Instagram Live on Sunday . While the 51-year-old cops to the fact that he s no angel ( for example : I admit , I admit that I did / I f *** ed my girlfriend s best friend / Yeah I tapped that in the back of my Benz ) and says he s sorry for my sins , he hits back against the cult claims that were first brought to light one year ago . While at first Kelly is seemingly dismissive about the whole thing singing , What s the definition of a cult ? / What s the definition of a sex slave ? / Go to the dictionary , look it up / Let me know I ll be here waiting he then denies the allegations . The claims were at first made by the parents of women living with the Grammy winner but later included women who alleged they were manipulated , controlled , and abused by Kelly . ( One woman claimed the star knowingly gave her a sexually transmitted disease . ) Say I m abusing these women . What the f *** ? That s some absurd s *** , Kelly sings . They brainwashed , really ? Kidnapped , really ? Ca n t eat , really ? Real talk that s *** sounds silly . His defense also includes lines about how he admits he s a freak who used to go to strip clubs every week and he admits that he likes to f *** with ladies both older and young ( tell me how they call it pedophile because that s *** is crazy ) . He then awkwardly details how the sex he has is always consensual , singing , I admit that I got some girls who love me to pull their hair / And I admit that they love to talk dirty while I pull their hair / Some like me to spank em / Some like to give brain / And what some of these girls want is too much for a radio station . Kelly also compared his relationship style to that of Hugh Hefner , who died last year . He said that when the Playboy founder and publisher left the world , he had a million girls , but we are always going to love Hugh Hefner . Kelly , who describes himself as the most disrespected artist and clearly sees himself as a victim , also addresses Spotify s decision to no longer promote his music at the height of the #MuteRKelly movement this past spring . ( Apple Music and Pandora later followed suit . ) Spotify , took me off they playlist / I admit that I , been underrated / I m not convicted , not arrested , but dragged my name in the dirt , he sings . In the song , Kelly also revealed that he was molested as a young boy and sang about the late Aaliyah , with whom he had a relationship when she was a minor . Kelly was trending on Twitter Monday morning with people weighing in on his lyrical defense and it was n t pretty . Read more from Yahoo Entertainment :",

		"paragraph": "Hollywood lost one of its most magnetic marquee icons today with the passing of Burt Reynolds at the age of 82 . The hunky star made his name in the 1970s and 1980s with a string of hits that took expert advantage of his good-humored macho charisma . And he also earned critical acclaim for his big-screen performance in Paul Thomas Anderson s 1997 gem Boogie Nights . According to his co-star in that modern classic , however , Reynolds detested the film . As Mark Wahlberg once explained to Yahoo Entertainment ( watch above ) , the Smokey and the Bandit and Gator headliner was far from a fan of Anderson s California-set porn opus , even though he received raves for his turn as adult film auteur Jack Horner including an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor . Hated it , hated it is how Wahlberg ( who played aspiring X-rated stud Dirk Diggler in the film ) described Reynolds s feelings about the project . We were on the red carpet and he grabbed me in a headlock and said , ‘ I do n t know why they like this movie so much , kid . But let s just go with it . Wahlberg believes that Reynolds s derision of the film and his subsequent refusal to campaign in the lead-up to the Academy Awards wound up costing him a statuette . He would have won the Oscar had he not dug such a hole for himself . Reynolds s big problem with the film , according to Wahlberg , was the rhythm of Anderson s script , to which he had a hard time getting accustomed . That motivated Reynolds to try to play his part with an Irish accent a bizarre move that caused Wahlberg to burst out in laughter on the set , and which Anderson humored for a few takes but finally ( and wisely ) nixed . Though Reynolds claimed to have never seen the finished film , Wahlberg remains convinced that Burt is fantastic in the movie , and I think he realized later on . One of the great performances of all time . Read more at Yahoo Entertainment :",

		"paragraph": "Sunday s season premiere of Keeping Up With the Kardashians was intense , to say the least . In it , Kim and Kourtney Kardashian tore into each other over the planning of their annual family Christmas card . It all started when Kourtney told Kim that she would n t do the shoot if it did n t work with her schedule . Kim was n t impressed and told her sister to get the f *** out of here and go . No one wants you in the f *** ing shoot . Kim then got completely vicious . Maybe if you had a f *** ing business that you were passionate about , then you would know what it takes to run a f *** ing business . But you do n t , so do n t even act like you know what I m talking about , she said . Kourtney stormed out , but heard Kim say this as she left : She s the least exciting to look at , so she can be out . She does n t do s *** . She does n t know what it s like to actually have work to do . Kourtney later told Kim that she thinks her family is disgusting and that she s ashamed to be a part of it . She also told Kim , You re a very distraught , evil human being . I do n t want to see you , OK ? I do n t agree with who you are as a human being . It did n t end there : Khlo Kardashian tweeted on Sunday night that she just wanted peace , and Kourtney responded with this : And then Khlo responded : Kourtney later made it clear on Twitter that she loves her sisters she just does n t like the way they fight : But then she reignited things when she tweeted this out : Kim s response : However , Kim made sure to tweet this : Whew . For the record , these vicious fights are more about being siblings and less about being sisters . Having two brothers and no sisters , I can tell you that brothers fight as vigorously , if not more , licensed clinical psychologist John Mayer , author of Family Fit : Find Your Balance in Life , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . However , sisters tend to fight more over emotional factors , while brothers tend to fight more over egotistical elements , licensed clinical psychologist Ramani Durvasula , author of Should I Stay or Should I Go ? , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . Sibling fights are so intense because there s a lot of history behind these relationships , Durvasula says . Siblings likely fought as children , she points out , creating a precedent for the way conflict is handled among them . Every sibling fight seems to devolve into something very primitive , she says . The stakes often seem higher . Not only that , but there may be unresolved conflicts from the past that keep surfacing or getting dragged into arguments , which can quickly take a fight over something like scheduling and make it much more heated . Still , most people feel that their love for their siblings is unconditional and vice versa , and that can lead people to take things further than they would in arguments with other people in their lives , such as friends , Durvasula says . If you tend to have extremely heated arguments with your siblings , Mayer recommends trying to view those relationships like the non-sibling relationships in your life . What I teach young people is to treat your family members exactly how you would someone you work with , a classmate , teacher , or coach , he says . You would n t think of treating them in that same way . It s also crucial to stop dragging in old baggage , Durvasula says . It s important to ask yourself if you re really arguing over the issue at hand or something that dates way back to when you were teenagers , she says . Take a step back and see what you were arguing about . Focusing on just that might help keep things more civil the next time around .

		"paragraph": "When the paperwork arrived Monday , Marion Street was furious . Eight hundred miles away , so was Shawn Jefferson . Their sons both play football at Mississippi . Jarrion Street is a true sophomore reserve linebacker redshirt sophomore Van Jefferson was the Rebels second-leading receiver in 2017 . And when the NCAA hit Ole Miss Friday with a second postseason ban , this one for 2018 after the self-imposed ban for this season , the players quickly requested permission to contact other schools in search of a transfer . Several other Rebels did the same . Permission to contact was granted Monday with limitations . No other Southeastern Conference school can contact Street or Jefferson , nor the eight non-conference opponents on the Ole Miss schedule in 2018 and 19 . While limiting transfer options is shamefully common in college athletics , the circumstances here are quite uncommon . Despite major rule-breaking by the school and despite what the parents of those players describe as institutional dishonesty about the potential sanctions , Ole Miss was still refusing to permit players to transfer without restriction . Until Tuesday . Faced with more negative headlines in a year full of them , the athletic department had an abrupt change of policy . After receiving a Yahoo Sports request for comment on the situation shortly after noon ET , the school released a statement at 1:20 p.m. saying that it is removing transfer restrictions . As far as the limitations initially placed on the permission to contact , the restrictions are common , the athletic department statement to Yahoo Sports said . Until we were notified [ Tuesday ] morning , none of the student-athletes had communicated they were unhappy with those restrictions . Frankly , if they had any objections and a legitimate reason to seek transfer to one of the limited schools , we would ordinarily work through those issues with the student-athlete and his family . The student-athlete s best interest is always the priority . Coach [ Matt ] Luke and [ athletic director ] Ross Bjork discussed the matter this morning . To be consistent , they are removing any restrictions on their permission to contact for all those who have requested permission . Our compliance office has reached out to the student-athletes to let them know . Faced with even more negative publicity , the school wisely chose to do the right thing and do it quickly . That should satisfy some parents who were seething earlier in the day . The ethical thing to do would be to say , ‘ We screwed up and we re going to let your son go where he wants , said Shawn Jefferson , wide receivers coach of the Miami Dolphins . Keep the kids first . When they recruited Van , Ole Miss came into our house and broke bread with us . They said , ‘ We re going to be an extension of his parents and take care of him and do things right . That was a bunch of bull - . We expected them to be about the truth and honesty , and we got the exact opposite . Right now I feel like my son has nowhere to go , and this is awful , Marion Street said . If Ole Miss had just been honest with us but to just outright say there is nothing wrong [ during the NCAA investigation ] ? Could you imagine if this is your child ? Street and her fianc , Nate Hope , gave a clear recounting of Jarrion s official recruiting visit to Ole Miss , which happened to coincide with Yahoo Sports January 2016 reporting about the school having received the NCAA s Notice of Allegations . The story broke while they were driving from their home in Trussville , Alabama , to Oxford , Mississippi , for the recruiting weekend . Text messages began flooding into their phones , from various parties asking whether Jarrion might want to reconsider his commitment to Ole Miss . But they kept the car pointed toward Oxford and stuck with their plans . Upon arrival , Marion Street said they asked assistant coach Derrick Nix about the allegations . She said Nix referred them to head coach Hugh Freeze . During the course of the weekend , Freeze addressed the situation in both group and private settings , they said . During a recruiting dinner at The Inn at Ole Miss , both Marion Street and Hope said Freeze stood on a chair to address the recruits , and Marion specifically asked him about the NCAA situation . She said Freeze responded that it was nothing to worry about . At another point during the weekend , Jarrion , Marion , Nate and Jarrion s sister all spoke privately with Freeze and asked him again about the situation . Marion Street said Freeze referenced his faith , said he was a man of his word and reiterated that this would not significantly affect her son . He mentioned the possibility of the Rebels losing a couple of scholarships , she said , but that was the worst thing that could happen . During that conversation , the family said Freeze asked Jarrion , Do I have your word that you re coming ? Raised to keep his promises , Jarrion said he would honor his commitment . Driving home Sunday , the family received calls from Auburn coach Gus Malzahn . He had been recruiting Jarrion , and wanted him to make a last-minute trip to the school on the way home the dead period before signing day started the following day . Malzahn pushed hard and Jarrion considered it . But Hope , who had become Jarrion s father figure after his real dad , Jarrion Sr. , died of leukemia in 2010 , counseled him against the visit . He stressed the importance of keeping a promise . He trusted us in our judgement as parents , Hope said . My stepson trusted me and I let him down . There s nothing Ole Miss can say to me to make me feel better . I was an officer in the Army , and if I told my soldiers something , they trusted me . This is the same type of thing . The situation could have been totally different if someone had told the truth . Van Jefferson already was on campus at Ole Miss as a redshirt freshman when the news of the Notice of Allegations broke in January 2016 . His father remembers similar assurances being given then to players about the nature of what the football program could be facing . Today , his highly marketable son can now receive and appraise transfer offers from all over including the SEC . Considered a four-star prospect coming out of high school in Tennessee , Jefferson had scholarship offers from at least eight SEC schools . To be told initially that those schools were off-limits by a program that was found to have committed major violations elevated Shawn Jefferson s blood pressure . I thought it was kind of bush-league for them to do this , the elder Jefferson said . It s amazing that they can do wrong and still try to control kids futures . [ Ole Miss coaches and administrators ] probably knew all along this was going to be a whopper [ of an NCAA case ] . These kids were lied to , and I just think it s wrong . Faced with trying to fight Ole Miss , the Jeffersons , Streets and others seeking to transfer did the smart thing they retained the services of attorney Thomas Mars . His bloody civil battle with the school on behalf of former coach Houston Nutt became a major facet of this traumatic year for Mississippi , and he was eager to take up the cause of the Rebels seeking to play elsewhere . On Monday , Mars took up the fight by emailing the school s legal counsel . On Tuesday morning , the families were speaking out to Yahoo Sports . On Tuesday afternoon , Ole Miss was setting the players free . Let s put these kids future first , Mars said , instead of treating them like they re furniture that belongs to the University of Mississippi .

That she died might not have come as a big surprise , but the exact circumstances of Sasha s death and how it impacted her friends in Alexandria made for a sad , shocking end for the character who had emerged as one of the biggest heroes of The Walking Dead Season 7 . Sasha whose portrayer , Sonequa Martin-Green , had already been announced as the star of the upcoming Star Trek : Discovery series on CBS All Access was taken to Alexandria by Negan , where he was going to use her as a bargaining chip before doling out punishment to Rick for his plot to overthrow Negan and the Saviors . Sasha was transported to Alexandria in a coffin . Negan planned to pop it open and reveal her to her friends , but she was the one with the surprise : When he opened the burial box , Sasha or rather , walker Sasha jumped on him . She had taken Eugene s suicide pill , and reanimated just in time to turn Negan s plan around on him temporarily . But the baddie with the bat had more tricks up his sleeve . As fans had been theorizing , Jadis and her Heapsters , supposed allies to the Alexandrians after Rick and company secured a cache of weapons for them , turned on Rick , holding he and his people hostage with those very guns . Just as Negan planned to make Carl s head and Rick s hands Lucille s latest victims , it was another pair of women who saved the day : Carol , accompanied by Ezekiel , Morgan , and the Kingdomites , and Maggie , with her Hilltop army , arrived with their own guns blazing , to save Rick and Carl , and help the rest of the Alexandrians run Negan out of town . Oh , make that a trio of ladies : Ezekiel s tiger , Shiva , also did her part in shutting down some Saviors and Heapsters and driving them out of Alexandria . Sasha , thanks to some flashbacks and a surprise guest appearance by former cast member Michael Cudlitz , at least had some fond memories of her all too brief romance with Abraham before her death . And she gave her friends a fighting chance in their plan to take on Negan , who officially declared war on #TeamRick after returning to the Sanctuary at the end of the season finale .

[ Follow Ball Do n t Lie on social media : Twitter | Instagram | Facebook | Tumblr ] This , via former Duke point guard turned ESPN college basketball analyst Jay Williams : You know Williams just dropped an outrageous nugget when even Bob Ley , who has seen just about every sports story possible as host of ESPN s Outside the Lines since 1990 , exclaims , What ?! That s right . Phil Jackson has somehow managed to outdo an actual meme involving Phil Jackson : This comes on the heels of Jackson openly acknowledging trade discussions involving 21-year-old Knicks phenom Kristaps Porzingis because of concerns about the future , which is a little like the Golden State Warriors actively shopping Kevin Durant over concerns about the present . And that comes on the heels of Jackson spending an entire season ridiculing Knicks star Carmelo Anthony and leaving his exit interview saying , He is a player that would be better somewhere else . And that came on the heels of Jackson thinking Derek Fisher and Kurtis Rambis were great hires . But of all the ridiculous looks Jackson has given us , falling asleep while working out somebody you might be selecting with the No. 8 overall pick might be the most ludicrous . It s a fairly hilarious image , but seriously , it s almost as if Jackson agrees with Knicks fans and is actively trying to get fired .

		"paragraph": "PARK CITY , Utah ( AP ) He once called Donald Trump \" a con man , \" but Mitt Romney now predicts that Trump would \" easily \" win his party 's presidential nomination in 2020 and \" solidly \" win a second term . Romney , the GOP 's failed 2012 presidential nominee from Massachusetts , now a Republican Senate candidate in Utah , made the prediction Thursday as he welcomed dozens of high-profile business and political leaders to a mountainside retreat in Utah Thursday night . As he has every year since 2012 , Romney played host to an invitation-only summit focused on the future of American leadership at home and abroad . The future , he predicted , would feature Trump as America 's leader at least for another six years . \" I think that not just because of the strong economy and the fact that people are going to see increasingly rising wages , \" Romney said , \" but I think it 's also true because I think our Democrat friends are likely to nominate someone who is really out of the mainstream of American thought and will make it easier for a president who 's presiding over a growing economy . \" The remarks from Romney marked a sharp reversal from his original impression of Trump . Romney briefly served as the face of the so-called \" Never Trump \" movement before the 2016 election . He delivered a scathing speech in Utah before the 2016 election , calling Trump \" a con man \" and \" a fake . \" Yet Romney 's criticism has softened since then . And now , in the midst of a Republican Senate primary campaign , the former Massachusetts governor appears to be embracing Trump and his leadership role in the modern-day Republican Party . He delivered the remarks on the first day of a three-day , closed-door summit in Utah 's mountains . The Associated Press was allowed to listen to Romney 's remarks during the event 's opening reception . Dignitaries on the guest list feature included House Speaker Paul Ryan , billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , and Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner in addition to actor Seth Rogin , former Starbuck CEO Howard Schultz and former Domino 's Pizza CEO Patrick Doyle . While there were many Trump skeptics in the crowd , a handful of Trump loyalists were in attendance as well , including short-lived White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci and Blackrock CEO Stephen Schwarzman . It wo n't be all business . Guests will have an opportunity to go skeet shooting with Ryan or hiking with Romney . \" I 'm looking forward to an unusual and packed couple of days here , \" Romney said , suggesting he would have little more to say about politics . \" Campaigns are off limits . \"",

		"paragraph": "Vinyl wrapped up its first season Sunday night on HBO with a spray-painted rave-up that attempted to psych out the viewing audience , to convince us that this series has the sound and vision that will leave us wanting to see next season s grand plan for the advent of late-1970s punk and disco . The tenth-episode finale was written by the show s co-creator and show-runner Terence Winter , and was his swan song , since he and HBO have parted ways . Those replacing him have a lot of mop-up work to do . Beginning to the strains of The Count Five s Psychotic Reaction and ending with the MC5 s Kick Out the Jams in other words , from a great one-hit wonder to a great cult song , neither of which would have actually helped Richie Finestra ( Bobby Cannavale ) save his record label the Vinyl episode entitled Alibi did a great job of summing up most of what s been wrong with Vinyl . It managed to extend the show s organized-crime subplot without giving us any resolution or thrills ( you knew that it was Bo Dietl s Corso who was going to bite the bullet as the only expendable character in that Goodfellas/Casino-ish execution scene ) . The episode disastrously re-positioned the show s most interesting character Ray Romano s Zak as a doofus who s lost his spirit . Oh , and Olivia Wilde s Devon , one of the few Vinyl supporting players who s always been intriguing , was nowhere to be seen at all . Instead , there was an increase in soap opera : We were supposed to believe that James Jagger s Kip would be so heartbroken that Juno Temple s Jamie would favor the other guy over him in last week s threesome that he d risk breaking up the Nasty Bits and , for good measure , overdose in abject self-pity . Vinyl prides itself on its foreshadowing of the coming trends in the ‘ 70s , and this episode ladled out irony straining to be hip : the white mail-room guy bleating that this dance music i.e. , nascent disco is the next big thing , and Richie sitting in a bar that s about to become that crud crucible of Lower East Side punk , CBGB . ( I m really not looking forward to seeing an actor try to mimic the wide-eyed starving-robot moves of David Byrne gulping out the lyrics to Talking Heads Psycho Killer next season . ) For every nice touch the recreation of the Academy of Music continued to be impeccable there was a sour note : Am I the only pair of ears that hears early-period Tom Petty , not punk , in the Bits Woman Like You ? As Vinyl went out with a final scene that found Richie making what seemed like his 18th speech about the youth-inspiring power of rock & roll , and then breaking out a case of spray-paint cans to encourage a room full of inside-the-biz revelers to wreck the offices of American Century/Alibi Records in the spirit of liberating anarchy , you had to wonder : Can this show be saved ? Is there a way for a Vinyl that s not led by Terence Winter , but which is still damp with the nostalgia felt by producers Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger , to wring itself dry , pull itself together , and become a period drama of some originality ? I truly I hope so . Because just as there was no way I was ever going to miss an episode of the first , extravagantly flawed season of Vinyl , there s also no way I ll ever miss watching what HBO and the producers try to do next season to redeem the series . I look forward to Vinyl s foray into disco : It had better do Donna Summer justice , and I want the show s new theme music to be permanently changed to the Trammps Disco Inferno . But if season two is going to use CBGB as its ground-zero , they d better start their nationwide search for someone to mimic Tom Verlaine playing guitar right now , because that means we re going to be watching television about Television .",

Gigi Hadid is the latest celebrity to speak out after being body-shamed , addressing people who claim she s gotten too skinny . In a series of tweets on Sunday , Hadid answered people who have been calling her out for her weight , citing her battle with Hashimoto s disease . Hadid is not the only celebrity who has been body-shamed while struggling with an illness . Actress Sarah Hyland wrote on Twitter in May that she has n t had the greatest year and pointed out that her weight has fluctuated in the past as a result of a kidney transplant in 2012 . However , she did n t give specifics on whether that was linked to her current health issues . I will say that this year brought a lot of changes and with that , physical changes , she continued . I am not a fan of ‘ being skinny . Which many of you have told me that I am too much of . ‘ Eat a burger , ‘ your head is bigger than your body and that s disgusting . And you re right ! I should eat a burger ! ‘ Cause they re fucking delicious ! But guess what . I do . Hyland also said that she d basically been on bed rest for the past few months , causing her to lose a lot of muscle mass . My circumstances have put me in a place where I m not in control of what my body looks like . So I strive to be as healthy as possible , as everyone should . Oh , and no , that s not Photoshop . Those are my legs . Those are my arms , she said . Hyland added that no one should aim to be the weight that I am at right now and that , while she s not thrilled with the way her body looks , it s due to her health and she ca n t please everyone . In 2015 , breast cancer survivor and E! host Giuliana Rancic told People that she was accused of having an eating disorder after a weight loss , which she attributed to a cancer-suppressing medication . It s really hurtful , she said . I m sorry that some people think I m disgustingly skinny , as they put it , but there s nothing I can do . I m lucky that I even have the type of cancer that reacts to the medicine . She added that it s hard for her to look in the mirror at times . I am really thin , Rancic said . I want to look fit and beautiful and sexy , and I ca n t . Of course , people have been body-shamed for gaining weight when they have an illness as well as for losing weight .

But it can be pretty difficult to deal with being shamed and deal with an illness at the same time , psychologist and body image expert Sari Shepphird , PhD , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . It s hard enough to feel like anyone can relate to you when you have a serious illness , she says . You already feel like you re not yourself , and dealing with body-shaming can tear a person down tremendously . In general , body-shaming ‘ devalues people and reduces their self-worth down to their outward appearance , Tom Hildebrandt , PsyD , chief of the Division of Eating Disorders at Mount Sinai Health System , tells Yahoo Lifestyle . If you re struggling with an illness on top of that , it can make someone feel worse about themselves at a time when they may already be having difficulty with body changes they re going through , he says and that can lead to low self-esteem , depression , and problems with eating . If you re body-shamed , Hildebrandt recommends treating the comments like a racial slur that is , something that s incredibly offensive and wrong . For some reason , body-shaming is seen as somehow more acceptable than other forms of bullying , and it s important to show people that it s actually not . People should be held accountable , he says . There s no context where body-shaming is useful or healthy .

		"paragraph": "This news has been getting a lot of attention lately : China s economy is now larger than America s , if you exclude exchange rates and other factors . And even if measured the most conventional way -- using total GDP -- China s economy is bound to outgrow America s eventually , since the Middle Kingdom has three times the population of the United States and a rapidly swelling consumer class . China has become Americans favorite bogeyman , even more than Russia and its sinister leader , Vladimir Putin . To many people , the rise of China is synonymous with America s decline . For the last four years , more than half of people polled have told Gallup that China is the world s most powerful economy , with just 32 % saying the U.S. is tops in the latest survey . In 2000 , 65 % named America most powerful , with Japan second , at 16 % . Only 10 % named China as No. 1 back then . These worries are easily refuted , as several commentators have done in response to hysteria over China s growth . For one thing , income and GDP are far higher in the U.S. when measured on a per capita basis , which is a much better gauge of wealth , prosperity and economic power than the total amount of output . America may still be the most innovative nation in the world , as well , with Silicon Valley the epicenter of digital technology that s transforming the entire planet . The United States has many other advantages China lacks , such as terrific universities , bounteous natural resources , dynamic capital markets and more-or-less effective rule of law . We ve been squandering some of those advantages through fractious politics and self-destructive greed , yet it has been the United States , and no other country , leading the world out of a deep global economic slump . Instead of worrying about who might be bigger , we d be a lot better off worrying about how to remain productive and efficient . A big economy , for one thing , does n t guarantee high living standards . GDP per capita , in fact , is highest in small nations , with Luxembourg , Norway and Qatar ranking 1 , 2 and 3 , according to the World Bank . The U.S. ranks No. 10 , with GDP per capita of about $ 53,000 . Germany is 18th ( $ 45,000 ) , Japan is 23rd ( $ 38,500 ) , and China is 70th ( $ 6,800 ) . [ Get the Latest Market Data and News with the Yahoo Finance App ] In the business world , size can be an impediment to profitability . Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ ) is currently trying to break itself into two , because its CEO and many shareholders feel two separate companies could perform better than one monolithic whole . General Motors ( GM ) foundered when it had eight automotive divisions more than twice as many as any competitor but is cruising now that it has only four . Economists frequently point out that the most dynamic companies are n t big established ones , but fast-growing younger ones , which is where most job creation comes from . What Americans should be worried about is recapturing the dynamism that seems to have leaked out of the U.S. economy during the last decade or so . Too many adults are sputtering in their careers or sitting on the sidelines , out of work . A lot of them blame Washington for their predicament with justification but there s also a lot of evidence people are n t doing enough to spring themselves out of a rut . Millions of Americans have lived beyond their means for years , leaving themselves shackled with debt . Companies ca n t find enough workers to fill certain middle-skill jobs such as sales reps and tradesmen , partly because people are n t willing to go where the work is or get the required training . China is n t a superpower , but it may become one , and in some ways it s already a tough competitor . Its military has become assertive in the South China Sea and elsewhere . Its state-owned companies have aggressively formed alliances in Africa , Latin America and other up-and-coming regions the West tends to neglect . China also has large vulnerabilities rampant corruption , many hollow companies propped up by state spending , and a spotty legal code that s not ready for prime time . It will solve some of those problems and trip over others , just as other nations , including the United States , have done . China will only overtake America , however , if we get too sclerotic and slow to maintain our lead . That could certainly happen , if venal politicians , Wall Street charlatans and overentitled , underinformed citizens pursue self-interest beyond the point of national interest . If that happens , the size of our economy wo n t have anything to do with it . But the size of our egos will . Rick Newman s latest book is Rebounders : How Winners Pivot From Setback To Success .

		"paragraph": "From ELLE Serena Williams called it her Black Panther suit . Custom designed with Nike to prevent blood clots-the health condition that nearly killed Williams after she gave birth to her daughter-Williams said the full-length black catsuit made her feel like a superhero . The French Tennis Federation called it disrespectful . In an interview with Tennis Magazine last week , FTF president Bernard Giudicelli announced they will be changing the French Open s dress code going forward . Serena s outfit this year , for example , would no longer be accepted , he said . One must respect the game and the place . Williams , for her part , seems unbothered . Responding to the comments on Saturday , Williams said she has a good relationship with Giudicelli and is confident they would come to an understanding . If they know that some things are for health reasons , then there s no way they would n t be okay with it , she said . At the U.S. Open last night , Williams was in dominant form-and back in stand-out style . For first-round win over Poland 's Magda Linette , she wore a black , one-sleeve tutu designed by Virgil Abloh . Williams 's singular on-court style often feels like a metaphor for all the other ways she is singular : the world 's best player and the black star of an overwhelmingly white , historically exclusionary sport . So to fans and observers , the catsuit ban was the latest instance of Williams facing racial discrimination within a sport she has single-handedly propelled forward . From racist slurs at Indian Wells to disproportionate drug testing to comments comparing her to an animal or a man , the sport continually sends the message that Williams does n t belong . Her strong black body-now uncovered by a skirt-seems to be perceived as a threat to tennis status quo . The FTF s updated dress code reflects a troubling desire to uphold ideas about respectability and femininity-white femininity , specifically-in women s sports , a tradition that dates back more than a century in the US . In the beginning of the twentieth century , women s participation in sports was dictated by the skirt theory : the only sports acceptable for women were ones they could play without wearing pants . The 1914 Olympic Committee opposed women taking part in any event in which they could not wear long skirts . Sports like golf , archery , and croquet were most popular , but women managed to play baseball in full-length skirts , as well as ice skate . In the 1870s , then women s college Vassar 's baseball team , the Resolutes played the game in the era 's cumbersome fashion . As long as women continued to play in skirts , the thinking went , white men did n t need to fear white women had abandoned their feminine duties to live like men . We see remnants of this thinking today : just last year , Toronto Blue Jays manager John Gibbons responded to what he perceived as a softening of baseball rules by saying that his team might as well come out wearing dresses next game . His commentary ties into patriarchal ideas about femininity and weakness , yes , but also the notion that anyone who plays in skirts could not also be considered a serious athlete . Women took it upon themselves to shorten their skirts , giving them the freedom of movement to compete at higher levels . In the 1920s , Norwegian figure skater Sonja Henie scandalized the skating community when she shortened her skirt to her knees , allowing her to spin and jump like the male skaters did . When the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League came around in 1943 , women were again required to wear skirts to play baseball - though they were much shorter now . Still , the skirts were not ideal for sliding , a problem made famous by the film A League of Their Own . But the short skirt or skort became entrenched as the female uniform for sports-in spite of the obvious impracticality . Until recently , even female boxers were asked to wear skirts . Today , dress codes for many women s sports are being policed by two seemingly opposed forces - modesty and objectification . Either cover up your body because it s inappropriate or a distraction , or reveal almost all of it because female athletes are primarily here for men s pleasure . Ever since women s sports began to be televised ( though , it should be noted , still at a rate far less than men s sports ) , the age-old demand for female modesty was met with a new demand to draw in audiences . Forced sexiness is no less sexist than forced modesty . In sports like track and field , gymnastics and volleyball , skimpy uniforms can prevent players who dress modestly , like Muslim athletes , from participating . It was 2004 before the International Skating Union did away with the rule that ladies must wear skirts and in 2012 , the International Volleyball Federation finally stopped requiring that female volleyball players wear bikinis , which many people saw as a sexist rule . Meanwhile , women in culturally conservative sports like tennis and golf must try to walk the line between attracting audiences and distracting them . These dress codes are not so different than the controversial school dress codes in place for girls . They use arbitrary moral standards to control women s bodies and expression-privileging onlookers opinions over those of the women wearing the clothes . Last year , the LPGA released a new dress code that has been criticized as slut-shaming . It includes guidelines like Length of skirt , skort , and shorts MUST be long enough to not see your bottom area … at any time , standing or bent over and plunging necklines are NOT allowed . Rarely , in discussing women s dress codes , do we discuss what s distracting for the athletes . When it comes to sports , safety and function need to come into play when choosing uniforms . But all too often morals and prejudice are the deciding factors . Williams was not the first female tennis player to attempt to buck tradition with a bodysuit . In 1985 , Anne White wore a white , full-length version to Wimbledon . Her opponent complained , she was not allowed to wear it again the next day , and news coverage was dominated by stories about her clothing . The chairman of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club , released a statement that said , in part , \" The rules state that clothes must be predominantly white and constitute ' normal tennis attire . ' Anne 's outfit was certainly all white but could hardly be called normal tennis attire . Calling Williams s catsuit disrespectful harkens back to racist and sexist ideas about what female athletes should be : white , feminine , and unserious . When athletes do n t conform to the these ideals that still dominate the sports landscape , they are criticized or , as in Williams s case , accused of not honoring the culture of the game . But Williams s influence , her outspokenness , and her on-court performances are the biggest selling points the sport of tennis has . Tennis has Williams - considered by many to be the greatest athlete ever - to thank for all the headlines generated by per talent and her personality . By banning her catsuit , the powers that be sent the message that upholding the status quo matters more than respecting their star athlete . By winning 6-4 , 6-0 in a headline-making tutu-black-designed , over-the-top feminine , and dead serious-Williams reminded us why she 's still the star . ( ' You Might Also Like ' , )",

		"paragraph": "FLOWERY BRANCH , Ga. ( AP ) The Atlanta Falcons will be missing another key starter for Sunday 's game against Carolina . Two-time Pro Bowl running back Devonta Freeman was ruled out after missing the entire week of practice with a knee injury , another blow to a team that was already reeling from injuries to defensive stalwarts Keanu Neal and Deion Jones . Coach Dan Quinn said he 's hopeful that Freeman 's injury is n't too serious . But there was a bit of uncertainty in the coach 's voice when he spoke after practice on a sweltering Friday afternoon . \" We 're under the hope that it 's not a long-term thing , \" Quinn said . \" When he can do the violent , explosive cuts that make him him , we 'll certainly get him in there . \" Freeman was injured in a season-opening loss to Philadelphia . Even though the Falcons had a 10-day break before their second game , the running back was not able to overcome the latest in what has become an alarming series of injuries . During the 2017 season , Freeman sustained two concussions and a right knee injury . He missed two games and was n't nearly as effective as the two previous years even when he was able to get on the field . Freeman finished with 865 yards rushing and seven touchdowns , along with 36 receptions . The starting spot is still in good hands with Tevin Coleman , but Freeman 's injury deprives the Falcons of their 1-2 punch out of the backfield . Rookie Ito Smith , a fourth-round draft pick , moves up on the depth chart . Recently signed Brian Hill could also get some playing time . The Falcons did n't even play Freeman during the preseason , wanting to ensure he was healthy when the games counted . Then he went down in the very first one . While Freeman is again dealing with an ailing right knee , Quinn said it 's not the same injury as last season . \" There 's nothing structurally wrong , \" the coach said . \" He got hit on it and it 's sore . When it bruises up and gets sore , you ca n't explode on it . He 's such a unique player , but when you ca n't do your stuff , you ca n't do it . \" In Week 1 , the Falcons lost Neal to a season-ending knee injury , while Jones was placed on injured reserve with a foot problem . The Falcons are hopeful that Jones will be able to return this season , but he will have to miss a minimum of eight games . Quinn said two backups also will miss Sunday 's game : offensive guard Ben Garland ( knee ) and receiver Russell Gage ( knee ) .

When Ford was in high school in the 1980s , she claims that Kavanaugh covered her mouth and attempted to rape her at a party an incident that left her dealing with PTSD and claustrophobia for the rest of her life , and which she detailed in a heartbreaking opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday . Ford s testimony was released the night before the hearing , and she read it nearly word-for-word . But this was the public s first time hearing her voice , observing her demeanor , witnessing her bravery . As senator Chuck Grassley delivered his opening statement , Ford was palpably nervous early into her testimony , she admitted that she was terrified . As she continued to speak , her voice trembled , but she powered through her prepared statement , barely breaking as she described the alleged assault and the moment she thought Kavanaugh might kill her . Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming , she told the Committee . This was what terrified me the most , and has had the most lasting impact on my life . It was hard for me to breathe , and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me . She also revealed the devastating moment she revealed the alleged sexual assault to her husband in 2012 . In a couple s counseling session , when she and her husband were remodeling their home , she insisted that she wanted to have a second front door a request her husband did not understand at the time . It was then that Ford opened up about her night with Kavanaugh , and the way in which has caused her to suffer from claustrophobia .

Although there s no question that it was devastating , some fans are n t so sure about the medical accuracy of what happened , and are even saying that Jack could have very easily been saved . Following numerous episodes that hinted at a destructive house fire caused by a faulty Crock-Pot , audiences were given the full story of Pearson family s heartbreaking loss . Although Rebecca , played by Mandy Moore , revealed the ultimate cause of death to be a deadly widowmaker heart attack as a result of smoke inhalation , some fans are pretty mad about it . In fact , a lot of people are saying that a simple , standard procedure could have saved the beloved character s life . All across Twitter , nurses are coming forward to explain that Jack needed to be intubated and that he just was n t . It seemed obvious to medical professionals watching that the hospital needed to tend to much more than Jack s visible scars . Nurses suggest that the show s medical staff should have addressed his oxygen levels after they realized that his burns were caused by smoke inhalation . Once Jack went into cardiac arrest , people believe that the hospital staff in the show let him go too soon . According to Dr. Richard Katz , director of the George Washington University Heart and Vascular Institute , who discussed what a widowmaker heart attack is with Time magazine , smoke inhalation is n t necessarily related . The sudden instance of this particular type of cardiac arrest is instead related to a build up of plaque blocking the left anterior descending artery . If Jack were to have had a pre-existing condition , the stress of the fire would be enough to lead him into a widowmaker heart attack . But as per the information provided in the episode , the Pearson patriarch had no known history of cardiovascular problems . For the sake of television , it s likely that the definition of a widowmaker was made broader for dramatic effect . Regardless , it will take a long time for fans to accept the loss .

It used your iPhone 's camera to scan documents , and it worked but it cost as much $ 4 per week , or over $ 200 per year , and was n't honest about signing people up for the recurring bill , according to user reviews . And now it 's zapped off the App Store entirely , apparently , after the TechCrunch story , along with most of the other apps mentioned in the story . Denys Zhadanov , VP at Readdle , which makes a competing scanner app , previously told Business Insider that he was not pleased that apps like Scanner App tricked users into paying hundreds of dollars , and grossing millions per year , versus his company 's app , Scanner Pro , which has the same functionality for a one-time $ 3.99 purchase . These shady subscription apps are enabled by a change Apple made in late 2016 , which allowed different kinds of apps to charge a recurring subscription fee , instead of a one-time , up-front cost . To make matters worse , some subscription apps have started using Apple 's App Store search advertisements to gain placement above less expensive alternatives when users searched . Apple has been aggressively pitching subscription fees to its top developers , including releasing a video evangelizing the subscription model earlier this year , and holding invite-only meetings in New York to encourage developers to try selling software on a subscription basis . At one meeting in early 2017 , an Apple representative said that paid apps represent 15 % of total app sales and is on the decline , suggesting to developers that subscription apps were the only way to create a sustainable business on Apple 's platforms . TechCrunch is n't the only outlet to publish a story on this particular scam . Forbes shined a light on it earlier this year , and in summer 2017 , Mashable reported on a virtual private network app that charged users $ 99 per week . Apple did n't immediately respond to a request for comment .

		"paragraph": "Taylor Swift who started her career in country music three years after the Dixie Chicks were driven off airwaves for taking a stand against the Iraq invasion has always been careful not to talk politics . Until now , that is . In an Instagram post on Sunday , Swift disclosed that she would be voting in Tennessee in November for two Democrats : former governor-turned-Senate hopeful Phil Bredesen and Rep. Jim Cooper , whose district includes Nashville . In the past I ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions , but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years , I feel very differently about that now , Swift wrote . I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country . I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights , and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG . I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying , sickening and prevalent . But Swift did n t just throw her weight behind Bredesen , she savaged his opponent , Marsha Blackburn , calling the Trump-endorsed congresswoman out for her votes against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act , Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and her support of homophobic policies . She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples . She also believes they should not have the right to marry . These are not MY Tennessee values , Swift wrote . High-profile Republicans and anonymous white nationalists online were bereft . The National Republican Senate Committee put out a statement Monday declaring multimillionaire pop star Taylor Swift came down from her ivory tower to tell hardworking Tennesseans to vote for Phil Bredesen . Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee tweeted dismissively , So @taylorswift13 has every right to be political but it wo n t impact election unless we allow 13 yr old girls to vote . Still with #MarshaBlackburn . And conservative personality Candace Owens volunteered to campaign for Blackburn in Tennessee , writing that Swift was using black people and minorities as pawns to brainwash people into doing their bidding . Charlie Kirk , founder of Turning Point USA , a conservative group best known for wearing adult diapers to protest liberal policies on college campuses , suggested on Fox News Monday morning that Swift did n t believe what she wrote . I do n t want to accuse her of this , but I do n t think she s the only one who wrote that post on Instagram , Kirk said . She probably got some very bad information . On the website 4chan , where a community of White nationalists have embraced Swift as an Aryan queen whose political silence was a tacit admission of racist sympathies , several users floated similar theories . That looks so ghost written . Ever notice how every celebrity seems to be reciting the same exact script and even use the same wording , one user wrote . Another added : All PR nonsense , she just does n t want to be labeled a white nationalist . Probably got paid to say all this . Users were nonetheless stricken by the development . OUR GIRL no more , one posted . They took her from us and turned her into one of their brain dead zombies , another wrote . Swift s endorsement is not without commercial risk . According to an analysis by the New York Times , she is most popular in rural areas in the West and Midwest that tend to vote conservative , like Utah , Montana and Nevada , and only modestly popular in Tennessee . Maybe an endorsement of Nevada candidate Jacky Rosen is next ?",

		"paragraph": "The Cleveland Cavaliers destroyed the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Sunday , leaping out to a 19-point lead that ballooned to 30 early in the fourth quarter before settling , thanks to decorum and bench-emptying , at 101-83 . This was to be expected . The Knicks entered Sunday having lost six straight and eight of their last 10 , inhabiting the dank depths of the NBA cellar at 10-44 , and without even the puncher 's chance of Carmelo Anthony , who has , at long last , shut it down . The Cavs , on the other hand , soared into MSG , having won 15 of 17 since the roster-remaking deals that imported former Knicks Timofey Mozgov , J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert and kickstarted Cleveland 's rise up the Eastern ranks . When one team is playing for the No. 1 pick and another 's playing for a No. 1 seed , this sort of outcome is n't surprising . [ Follow Dunks Do n't Lie on Tumblr : The best slams from all of basketball ] But seeing something coming does n't mean you ca n't be disappointed when it happens . Knicks president of basketball operations Phil Jackson just three weeks removed from terming his first full season in control of the Knicks an \" experiment [ that ] has fallen flat on its face \" was displeased enough by Sunday 's game to lob a couple of cryptic 140-character bombs : ( \" smh \" means \" shaking my head , \" for those readers who might not be as \" hip-hop ready to get going \" as the Zen Master , or as ON IT as The Grey Lady . ) That 's not entirely true , Mr. Jackson . ( Woo . ) You 've got to imagine that the basketball gods enjoyed this nice Cavs trip , beginning with a Mozgov swat of a Tim Hardaway Jr. layup , which LeBron James corralled and began to push up the court before throwing it ahead after one dribble to a streaking Smith , who took one bounce of his own before soaring in for a double-clutch two-handed slam : The same goes for Smith and Shumpert hooking up on this sweet alley-oop , which called to mind a connection with fellow now-former Knick Pablo Prigioni that represented one of J.R. 's finer moments in New York : \" I even told [ Smith ] in the timeout , ' Thank you for the price of admission , ' \" Cleveland coach David Blatt said after the game , according to Brian Mahoney of The Associated Press . \" That was special and really nice that it was here in New York . \" Sound interior defense , throwing the ball ahead to create early offense , opportunistic cutting , the ball barely touching the floor ... there was plenty to enjoy . It just did n't come from any Knicks . Or , at least , any current Knicks . \" They 've given us everything we 've asked , and more , \" James said of Smith , who finished with 17 points on 7-for-11 shooting , four assists , three rebounds , two blocks and a steal , and Shumpert , who added four points , seven assists and five rebounds , according to Joe Vardon of Northeast Ohio Media Group . \" We love them . I know I do . I love them and I 'm happy to have them on board . \" The feeling 's mutual for the former Knicks wings , whom Blatt called \" a godsend \" before the game , and who each struck notes of appreciation for both past and present , according to George Willis of the New York Post : And when you do n't ... well , woof . Days like Sunday make Jackson 's work thus far in dismantling and rebuilding the Knicks roster look especially shaky . Not only did Smith and Shumpert show out , but Tyson Chandler ( shipped out in June as Jackson began his teardown ) and Amar ' e Stoudemire ( bought out at the conclusion of the 2015 NBA All-Star Game at MSG ) each contributed to the Dallas Mavericks ' 11-point home win over the Charlotte Hornets . And while New York 's ex-pats looked strong for teams with title aspirations , the players the Knicks received in those deals veteran Jose Calderon and rookie Cleanthony Early from Dallas , journeymen forwards Lou Amundson and Lance Thomas from Cleveland did n't exactly evoke the days when the Garden was Eden . Funny we re in the situation we re in , Smith said Saturday , according to Marc Berman of the New York Post . Tyson in Dallas playing well , me and Shump here playing well . We were n t the fit they were looking for . Hopefully they find it . That is , of course , an overly simplified version of the way things went . By the ends of their tenures in New York , none of the three players were operating at the level they 've reached in their new settings Chandler seemed burnt out after having spent so much time as the Knicks ' defensive failsafe without much help or much hope of getting rewarded on offense Shumpert alternately battled injury and confidence issues for most of his final two years in Manhattan J.R. had , well , lots of different issues . None of them , by themselves or collectively , were the problem with a Knicks club that went from Atlantic Division champs to 37-45 in one year . But none of them , by themselves or collectively , seemed likely to be the solution , either , which is the kind of thing that leads ownership and front offices toward rebuilding . It falls to Jackson , now , to find the solution that will pull the Knicks out of the doldrums . He has staked the team 's future on the belief that that answer includes Anthony , the player the Knicks select with their lottery pick in the 2015 NBA draft , and the players they sign using their heaping gobs of future salary-cap space to fill out the roster with \" total basketball players \" capable of holding their own defensively and contributing within the systemic context of the triangle offense . That kind of rebuild is painful even when it presents occasional glimpses of that hoped-for better tomorrow . When it does n't , and when the guys you got rid of remind the fans of just how much they 're missing , well , heartburn and head-shaking soon follow , no matter what kind of paychecks you 're taking home .

It would also mean a nice payday for the investment bankers working on the deal . Perella Weinberg , JPMorgan ( JPM ) and Bank of America ( BAC ) are advising AT&T , according to Reuters . JPMorgan and Bank of America are also working on the bridge financing . Allen & Co. , Citigroup ( C ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS ) are advising Time Warner . If the Time Warner deal goes through , Freeman estimates that AT&T will pay an additional $ 90 million to $ 120 million in advisory fees , plus $ 110 million to $ 130 million for the bridge loan , according to estimates from boutique M&A advisory firm Freeman & Co . Freeman & Co. s records show that AT&T and Time Warner have paid close to $ 1.5 billion in investment banking fees in the past decade prior to the the AT&T - Time Warner deal announcement . AT&T alone has paid close to $ 1 billion in investment banking fees for M&A , bonds and loans in the last decade . Notable deals include AT&T s acquisitions of Leap Wireless in 2013 and DirecTV in 2015 . Time Warner has paid about $ 455 million in that time . Notable deals in recent years include the spinoffs of Time Warner Cable in 2009 and Time Inc. in 2014 . Time Warner should pay an additional $ 110-140 million for their sale to AT&T , Freeman estimates .

The telecom giant currently ranked No. 5 among US companies ( excluding financial institutions and funds ) for investment banking fees paid in the last decade , according to Freeman & Co . GE ( GE ) is currently ranked No. 1 with $ 3.64 billion in investment banking fees , followed by Ford Motor ( F ) Charter Communications ( CHTR ) , Verizon Communications ( VZ ) , and AT&T .

		"paragraph": "It s that time of year when network television renews or cancels some of your favorite shows , and now there s a cancellation that has fans upset for an unusual reason . Soon after ABC announced it was yanking the Tim Allen sitcom Last Man Standing after six seasons , a segment of that series most vocal supporters believed they knew why : Because Allen is a vocal Hollywood conservative . The right-wing blog Dailywire.com ran a story late last week headlined , Despite High Ratings , ABC Cancels Trump-Friendly Sitcom Last Man Standing . Wisconsin governor Scott Walker linked to that story and tweeted at Allen , Looks like ABC is playing politics with your show despite decent ratings . Sad . Glenn Beck of the Blaze muttered darkly during an interview with Bill O Reilly on Beck s online radio show last week that he was going to start looking into why this show got canceled . So , is it true ? Is Last Man Standing a new example of authoritarian entertainment political correctness ? Last Man Standing , for those of you who do n t watch network family-hour Friday-night TV , told the tale of Mike Baxter ( Allen ) , one of the heads of an outdoor sporting-goods store in Denver . Married with three children , Mike was presented as part of a supposedly vanishing breed : the proud straight , white , monogamous , Christian , gun-shooting male . He spoke fondly of hunting , belittled men around him whom he considered too soft and sensitive , and railed against political correctness . Everyone around him treated Mike as one might a much older , senile person with kindness , care , and perhaps a little pity . Last Man Standing was n t a ratings blockbuster , but when you re on ABC on Friday night , you do n t need to be that time period simply requires that you remain competitive with the shows around you and do n t lose viewers year-to-year in a big way . In this , Last Man succeeded . Paired with the Ken Jeong sitcom Dr. Ken , Last Man was a solid performer for ABC and also did very well in syndication . Deadline reported that Last Man was the third most watched ABC scripted series overall behind Grey s Anatomy and Modern Family . So why was Last Man Standing canceled ? ABC has offered no reason , but one may be a now-common TV-business motivation : The show was produced by 20th Century Fox , not ABC itself , at a time when the networks like to own all their series for maximum profits . Another reason may be a scheduling strategy : Because ABC also canceled Dr. Ken , you could also conclude that the network wanted to give its Fridays-at-8 hour a fresh start in the fall , with new programming there . Fresh blood and all that . What are the arguments for a politically motivated cancellation ? Dailywire says the show is one of the very few aimed to appeal to America s heartland . Deadline claims Last Man is a blue-collar comedy appeals to viewers in the Heartland , a constituency that helped elect Donald Trump as president and has been energized postelection as evidenced by the ratings success of new USA drama Shooter . One thing these labels do is reduce Last Man to a lesser show than it was : If you actually watched the show past its first season , you d see that it became a slightly more interesting thing a show about maintaining common sense in a world gone a bit crazy , and one in which its female supporting cast ( led by Nancy Travis as Allen s wife ) was heard from just as forcefully as Allen s Mike was . If all of the above is true , you d think ABC would be motivated to renew Last Man , not cancel it appealing to a wide audience is n t that what network television is supposed to do ? So I think there might be something to the notion that the show s traditional-values theme got it canceled . If you re ABC in 2017 , you re looking at your primetime schedule and hoping to gain some traction , become more of a player in a TV world in which all the buzz is going to cable and streaming services , where programming is hipper , more adventurous , more artistically risk-taking . If you re an executive , you probably have n t watched Last Man Standing since screening the pilot six seasons ago you would n t be caught dead laughing at the antics of a 63-year-old comic like Allen . More to the point , you want your shows to attract younger , more diverse viewers and Last Man is n t really for that crowd . When you combine this with the notion that what s being pushed on Last Man would strike most cool-kid Los Angeles TV execs as a backward-looking social agenda , Last Man Standing becomes a much easier show to cancel than , say , American Crime , which lost many more viewers than Last Man did in the past season but which possesses a prestige , progressive aura and Emmy Awards . Crime was , indeed , canceled as well , but you can bet more hands were wrung over that decision than over yanking Allen s comedy off the schedule . So , yeah , I think that , if you want to be brusquely reductive , Last Man Standing could be said to be a victim of its conservative-in-every-sense image . I sincerely doubt that politically motivated protestors of the cancellation such as Gov. Scott Walker and Glenn Beck are regular viewers of the show , but if they , and the show s true fan base , want to turn this into the thousandth the media is totally left wing cause , have at it . Just do n t expect it to make one bit of difference to ABC .

		"paragraph": "OTTAWA The United States has backed away from its contentious demands for lucrative procurement projects in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement , The Canadian Press has learned . Mexico and Canada are both quietly taking credit for standing firm against the controversial U.S. position that would have effectively limited their respective countries ' ability to bid on valuable American government infrastructure projects . Multiple sources , speaking on the condition of anonymity , cited the competing claims as one example of the animosity between Canada and Mexico that has arisen since Mexico reached its own NAFTA deal with the Trump administration last month . Canada and the United States are trying to renegotiate their portion of the three-country trade pact at the heart of the continent 's economic prosperity , but major sticking points such as dairy , dispute resolution and culture remain . Canada has credited Mexico with making significant concessions in its deal with the U.S. on automobiles and for permitting large wage increases for Mexican auto workers something Canada and the U.S. both wanted to stop the growing flow of automobile production into Mexico because of its cheap labour . But Mexico believes it has also done much of the \" heavy lifting \" on getting the Americans to back down on its demand to limit the ability of Canadian and Mexican firms to bid on U.S. infrastructure projects , while seeking greater access for American firms to Mexican and Canadian government projects . The proposal offended Canada and Mexico when it was tabled by U.S. trade czar Robert Lighthizer last fall during the early rounds of the 13-month-old NAFTA renegotiation . The U.S. proposed a dollar-for-dollar approach that would have limited access for Canadian firms because Canada 's economy is so much smaller . Sources say Lighthizer withdrew that demand during this summer 's one-on-one negotiation with Mexico , returning the continent 's procurement rules to the status quo . Canada has privately expressed frustration with Mexico 's decision to strike its own deal with the U.S. last month . But one source familiar with how the negotiations have progressed said Canada was fully informed every step of the way on the Mexico-U.S. deal , noting Freeland and chief negotiator Steve Verheul were kept in the loop . The source said Canada transgressed first with a surprise auto proposal last spring that it gave directly to the U.S. without consulting Mexico . Mexico still wants Canada in a three-way deal , and ensured that the language in its deal with the U.S. was written to facilitate a trilateral agreement , the source said . Mexico feels its agreement works in Canada 's favour on a number of fronts , added the source . With dispute settlement very much a live issue between Ottawa and Washington , the U.S. and Mexico reached agreement on NAFTA 's Chapter 20 , the government-to-government dispute settlement mechanism , sources said . Mexico believes that opens an opportunity for Canada to preserve Chapter 19 , which is a deal-breaker for the Trudeau government . Chapter 19 allows for independent panels to resolve disputes involving companies and governments , but the U.S. wants it removed because it views it as an infringement of its national sovereignty . One proposal on the table is to fold Chapter 19 into Chapter 20 , a development that may not be fair to smaller and medium-sized companies , said Cyndee Todgham Cherniak , an international trade lawyer currently on Canada 's roster for Chapter 19 disputes . She said governments will be likely more inclined to take Chapter 20 cases forward in the interest of large enterprises such as softwood lumber or metals companies . \" The problem with it being in Chapter 20 is you 've got to convince your government to bring the case , \" she said . \" The government may not want to because it 's too small of an industry to spend the resources . \" This will create an injustice for small and medium-sized businesses , who quite frankly are the backbone of North American business . \" The U.S. and Canada are also working towards finding common ground on two other Canadian priorities : reflecting the rights of Indigenous people and women in the NAFTA text , sources say . Canada originally wanted distinct chapters on each but that fell off the table earlier this year , as the Trudeau government tried to break the NAFTA logjam with its so-called \" skinny NAFTA \" compromise that focused mainly on autos and dairy a proposal that Lighthizer ultimately rejected . Sources say the Canada-U.S. agreement could contain some language on women and Indigenous Peoples none of it binding on either the U.S. or Mexico that could potentially help Prime Minister Justin Trudeau claim a political victory back in Canada . Mexico had objected to the inclusion of a full Indigenous chapter , but sources say it has no problem with including the non-binding language if it helps Canada reach a deal with the U.S. Mike Blanchfield , The Canadian Press",

		"paragraph": "Anthony Bourdain was a chef , a writer , a TV host , and a celebrity . He taught people that brunch was a scam , that putting pen to paper is as much a noble act as it is a narcissistic one , that you really only need one outfit when you travel , and that selling out when you do n t have to is one of the fouler things a privileged person chooses to do . But more than that , Bourdain taught people that one of the most reliably good parts of humanity is getting the chance to learn and succumbing to it . Bourdain , who d cut his teeth in the frat house ambiance of the kitchen , did n t really begin traveling the world until he was in his 40s . After decades working as a chef and a struggling novelist , Bourdain found unlikely fame when a piece he wrote for The New Yorker turned into a book deal . The resulting biography Kitchen Confidential was hugely successful , and his publishers wanted more . Bourdain did , too . He teamed up with The Food Network in an attempt to kill two financial birds with one stone that someone would pay for him to travel the world to do research for a new book , and film the process at the same time . I went out there a total novice and neophyte borderline delusional , thinking ‘ this was n t going to hurt at all , he confessed in an episode of No Reservations shot in 2010 . The episode showed footage filmed right after he returned from A Cook s Tour . Bourdain s fatigue at the time was clear : I m traveling around the world and on film every waking minute , and I m not liking it . I want to hide under a blanket for the rest of my life , he says woodenly , without any of the pomposity that had juiced everything he said prior . The Bourdain depicted in A Cook s Tour is almost comically uncomfortable , a caricature of the Bourdain that we re familiar with it was the first time he was responsible for telling stories about real people other than himself , and the effort to get it right when he was so unprepared was obviously taxing . His most immediate first impression of the thing that has become his legacy can seem discordant . After all , the Bourdain who would eventually go on to host No Reservations and Parts Unknown as the ideal globe trekker is energized by new experiences . He was fearless and generous , and seemed to be powered by the same thing that so drained him in A Cook s Tour . But his initial reaction to travel illuminates something about Bourdain s philosophy to life that will later become so instinctive to him that it ll become invisible : Interacting with the world is not a pleasure , but it is a privilege . The most honest way to do it is humbly . When it comes to how most people travel and dine Bourdain s two main methods of interaction passivity is not a popular attitude . Why spend so much money on an unpleasant experience ? When you eat at a restaurant , it s likely that you ve picked the spot from many options and will pick from its menu to best flatter your tastes . The way we travel is similar : We pick experiences by what looks most appetizing , expecting to be delighted , catered to , and satiated by what comes across our table . We are the guests . Foreign lands are our hosts . That is not how Bourdain traveled . He was an interloper , not a guest , which meant that the onus to delight , to cater , and to satiate was entirely on him . That meant trusting people who chose to express their gratitude and love through foods many other food travelers would call bizarre and weird . Not once did he use these words as pejoratives , or more patronizingly , as some annoying shock-jock travelers do as badges of bravery . Bourdain traveled as someone with deep respect and deference to the people he was seeing . He took his shoes off when he went into a Japanese home without complaint . He sat down in a plastic stool with as much gratitude as if it were a Mies van der Rohe . He learned how to say thank you and excuse me in every language his hosts spoke , attempting to get the pronunciations right in ways that were so eager and earnest that it was almost embarrassing if you believed his punk veneer was all there was to him . Bourdain made it easier for us to indulge our own curiosities . It is no coincidence that in toxic conversations about cultural appropriation , eating foreign food is one of the only things where people feel no shame in seeking out and trying . For Bourdain , new foods were always an opportunity to connect with new people and new ideas . Bourdain understood that in seeing what someone eats and how they cook it , he could better understand why they live . Pop anthropologists have long done this before him , with music , with fashion , with sports , with sex but Bourdain was the first to break out of the niche subject he inhabited professionally , because he did it plainly and without pomp , without ever dumbing things down or dramatizing differences . One of the clearest pieces of evidence that his style was spot-on is from the surfeit of praise from people about episodes that featured their hometowns . This is an incredibly curious thing for a show ostensibly promoting places to travel to , not places to grow up in . When Bourdain visited Ecuador , my entire family tuned in , Washington Post reporter Marissa J. Lang tweeted . We did not watch with dread , waiting for the moment he would get it wrong . We watched feeling we would be seen . All morning , people have been describing what it was like to gather with their families to see their backyards through Bourdain s eyes , and know that it d feel both like falling in love for the first time and going home for Thanksgiving . Bourdain was as frank with himself as he was with the subjects he reported on . He has called himself much worse things than his critics have levied on him . He was his own harshest critic . Which is why he must have instinctively felt that the pain that s necessary to travel and tell other people s stories was a sign of his own weakness . But it s clear that he later realized that pain was only part of the journey to empathy and edification . He writes in his book , No Reservations : Around the World on an Empty Stomach : Travel is n't always pretty . It is n't always comfortable . Sometimes it hurts , it even breaks your heart . But that 's okay . The journey changes you it should change you . It leaves marks on your memory , on your consciousness , on your heart , and on your body . You take something with you . Hopefully , you leave something good behind . For someone who has traveled as much as he did , and who left behind so much good , one can imagine how much hurt and heartbreak it took to get there . On his blog , Bourdain s last post was written in 2016 , and in remembrance of poet Jim Harrison . Bourdain knew that his own superpower was that he was a conduit to tell other people s stories it was what made his programs so admirable , and his last post so particularly heart-wrenching . It must have meant something wickedly important to him , to see himself in these lines . Bourdain spent the past two decades reflecting our world back to us . As tribute , here s something he saw himself in : BARKING The moon comes up . The moon goes down . This is to inform you that I did n t die young . Age swept past me but I caught up . Spring has begun here and each day brings new birds up from Mexico . Yesterday I got a call from the outside world but I said no in thunder . I was a dog on a short chain and now there s no chain .

		"paragraph": "Jennifer Lawrence received fan adoration and critical acclaim for her performance as Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games films . Now she is getting another kind of recognition : as the inspiration for a new generation of activists . During our conversation with the Red Sparrow star , Yahoo Entertainment showed her a tweet from author Lyndsay Faye that held up Katniss as well as Harry Potter ‘ s Hermione as models for the teenage girls at the forefront of the #NeverAgain movement for gun control . Though Lawrence visibly cringed when we mentioned Twitter , she was thrilled to learn that Katniss might have helped teach young people how to speak truth to power . Watch the video above . That is really , really awesome , Lawrence responded . Breaking it down for her Red Sparrow co-star Joel Edgerton , she explained , I think that it means that putting empowering female characters out there is inspiring young people , which is great . Added the much-scrutinized star , That is the first positive thing I ve heard from the internet in years ! The students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School , some of whom have become outspoken advocates for gun control legislation in the wake of the Feb. 14 school shooting , would have been in upper elementary and middle school when the first Hunger Games movie opened in 2012 . In recent weeks , the name of the films heroine ( who ends up leading a rebellion to overthrow a corrupt government ) has appeared frequently in connection with the real-life teenage activists . Lawrence said that she feels honored by the comparison . I ve been so impressed by these students and what they re doing , Lawrence says . I m so proud and blown away to watch these young people engage and educate themselves and empower themselves . Red Sparrow opens in theaters on March 2 .",

		"paragraph": "The Latest on the 10th Sunday of the NFL season ( all times Eastern ) : 11:35 p.m. Tom Brady threw three touchdown passes and the New England Patriots matched their own AFC record with their 12th consecutive road win , pummeling the Denver Broncos 41-16 Sunday night . Brady improved to 8-9 against the Broncos , the only team he has a losing record against , and won for just the fourth time in 11 trips to Denver . His 86th regular season road win broke a tie with Peyton Manning for most all-time . These teams have represented the AFC in the last four Super Bowls , and the Broncos were hoping a visit from their rivals would help shake them from their funk , one that included a 28-point loss at Philadelphia a week earlier . Instead , the Broncos saw their losing streak reach five games , their longest skid in seven seasons , and they lost back-to-back games to the Patriots in Denver for the first time since 1966 . 10:55 p.m. Umpire Jeff Rice was taken off the field on a cart after he appeared to hit his head on the turf following a punt . Denver 's Jamal Carter was blocking New England 's Trevor Reilly when Reilly rolled into the back of Rice , whose legs were taken out from under him . Rice stayed down for several moments before walking to the cart late in the third quarter . Reilly came over to say something to Rice before Rice left the field . Pat Graham reporting from Denver . 10:25 p.m. Tom Brady was n't perfect in the first half . It only appeared that way . He did throw four incomplete passes . The New England quarterback was 12 of 16 for 136 yards and two TDs in the opening half against the Denver Broncos . His QB rating was 139.6 . Not only that , but Brady seamlessly worked newly acquired tight end Martellus Bennett back into the offense . Bennett caught two passes for 32 yards despite a shoulder injury that led to his release from Green Bay . The Patriots claimed Bennett on Thursday after he was waived . He played for New England last season . Pat Graham reporting from Denver . 9:35 p.m. It 's been a terrible special teams night for the Denver Broncos and it is n't even halftime yet . For openers , Isaiah McKenzie muffed a punt that set up Rex Burkhead 's 14-yard TD catch early in the first . Minutes later , Dion Lewis returned a kickoff 103 yards for a score . If all that was n't enough , Riley Dixon had his punt blocked by Burkhead . It led to 28-yard field goal from Stephen Gostkowski . 8:30 p.m. With just two games left in the NFL 's 10th week , the standings do n't look all that different than they looked before the week began . The Rams , Eagles , Saints and Vikings are in first place in the NFC , which no longer has a winless team , as the 49ers win over the Giants put San Francisco at 1-9 . In the AFC , the division leaders include the Chiefs , Steelers and Patriots ( who are playing in the late game against the Broncos ) . In the AFC South , the Jaguars and Titans are tied at 6-3 . Tennessee has a short week before traveling to play Pittsburgh Thursday . The Browns remain winless , and they face Jacksonville next week . 6:10 p.m. Running back Devonta Freeman has a concussion and has been ruled out of the Falcons ' game against the Cowboys . Freeman was hurt on Atlanta 's opening drive , when he was given the ball on the team 's first two plays . After gaining one yard on his first carry , he was hit by Cowboys linebacker Anthony Hitchens on second down . Freeman appeared shaken by the hit and walked off the field , escorted by trainers . After being taken to the team 's observation tent on the sideline , Freeman went to the locker room . Freeman missed the Falcons ' last two preseason games while in the concussion protocol . The injury leaves Tevin Coleman as Atlanta 's primary running back . Meanwhile , Cowboys linebacker Sean Lee is out with a hamstring injury also suffered in the first quarter . Charles Odum reporting from Atlanta 5:35 p.m. The Houston Texans defense is off to an impressive start against the high-powered Rams offense . Jadeveon Clowney and his teammates limited Jared Goff and the Rams to 131 total yards in the first half at the Coliseum , keeping Los Angeles out of the end zone entirely . The Rams entered the game with the NFL 's highest-scoring offense at 32.9 points per game . Greg Zuerlein hit three field goals for the Rams , who led 9-7 at halftime . Zuerlein has already surpassed his previous career-high for a season with 27 field goals in the first nine games for the Rams , who are mediocre in the red zone despite their prolific points totals . Greg Beacham reporting from Los Angeles 4:51 p.m. Three players took a knee during the national anthem before the New York Giants game at the San Francisco 49ers , as the rest of the league stood during Veterans Day weekend . 49ers Eric Reid and Marquise Goodwin , both of whom have been protesting for most of the season , knelt , as did Giants defensive end Olivier Vernon , who was just activated . Vernon had been protesting while he was injured . The NFL Players Association had asked all players to observe a two-minute moment of silence before games to honor veterans . Other players who have been protesting most of the season stood for the anthem this week , including the Seahawks Michael Bennett , who stood before Thursday night 's game . Titans receiver Rishard Matthews walked onto the field holding hands with soldiers and stood with teammates for the anthem for the first time since President Donald Trump criticized players for protesting . Former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began the protest movement last season . He remains unsigned and has filed a complaint that team owners colluded against him because of the protests aimed at police brutality against African-Americans and other issues . 3:52 p.m. Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Deshone Kizer is back on the field , trying to rally his team from a 14-point deficit late in the fourth quarter . He left the game with a rib injury after taking a hit from Quandre Diggs . After being evaluated in the locker room and watching Cody Kessler take some snaps , Kizer went back into the game with 4:28 left in the fourth quarter . Larry Lage reporting from Detroit . 2:52 p.m. Green Bay lost another running back when Ty Montgomery got hurt in the first half of the Packers ' game at Chicago . The team announced in the third quarter that Montgomery had a rib injury . Aaron Jones departed in the first quarter with a knee injury . Montgomery had a 37-yard touchdown run in the second , helping Green Bay to a 10-6 lead at the break . He finished with six carries for 54 yards . The injuries for Montgomery and Jones left the Packers with only one true halfback , Jamaal Williams . Montgomery started his career as a receiver and was converted to running back last season because of injuries . Jay Cohen reporting from Chicago 2:37 p.m. The New Orleans Saints say running back Daniel Lasco has feelings in his extremities after sustaining a spinal injury making a tackle on a kickoff return . Lasco was loaded into an ambulance on the field and taken to the hospital . He was hurt six minutes into the second quarter when he appeared to lower his head while tackling Bills returner Brandon Tate . Lasco moved his left leg while lying face-down on the field before being rolled on his back by Saints medical staff . John Wawrow , reporting from Orchard Park , New York . 2:05 p.m. Cincinnati linebacker Vontaze Burfict has been ejected for contact with an official . Burfict initially was flagged for a late hit on DeMarco Murray and apparently made contact with an official pleading his case . The flag for his ejection came two plays after the Murray hit . The linebacker did n't immediately leave the sideline . Murray dove over the top for a touchdown , putting Tennessee up 14-6 , before Burfict started walking toward the locker room . Burfict talked to some fans behind the team bench and raised both arms in the air before finally going to the locker room . The Bengals linebacker has been among NFL 's most suspended and most frequently fined players . He started this season with a three-game suspension for a hit during the preseason . He also had a history of personal fouls at Arizona State that factored into every NFL team passing on him in the 2012 draft . This is the second straight week the Bengals have had a player ejected . Wide receiver A.J. Green was ejected after grabbing Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey around the neck and throwing a punch . Green was fined $ 42,541 for his fight . Teresa M. Walker reporting from Nashville , Tennessee 2 p.m. Titans kicker Ryan Succop finally has missed , ending his NFL record of successful field goals inside 50 yards at 56 . Succop missed wide right on a 48-yard attempt with 8:05 left in the second quarter Sunday against Cincinnati . Succop came into the game having easily topped the previous NFL mark of 46 consecutive field goals inside the 50 that had previously been set by Matt Bryant of Atlanta between 2013 and 2015 . The Titans kicker came into this game 21 of 23 on field goals , and his 79 points ranked him third in the NFL . Teresa M. Walker reporting from Nashville , Tennessee 1:58 p.m. Corey Grant 's longest two runs of the season came on fake punts . Grant juked one defender , made another miss and then zigzagged his way for a 56-yard touchdown on a fourth-and-7 play against the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday . He had 58-yarder that was stopped set up a touchdown against Baltimore in London in September . It 's also the second straight week Jacksonville got a huge play from special teams . Jaydon Mickens returned a punt 63 yards for a touchdown in a 23-7 victory against Cincinnati last week . The Jaguars signed special teams coordinator Joe DeCamillis in the offseason in hopes of improving one of the league 's worst units . Mark Long reporting from Jacksonville , Florida 1:52 p.m. Green Bay running back Aaron Jones has left the Packers ' game at Chicago with a knee injury . Jones departed in the first quarter , but it was unclear when exactly he got hurt . The team announced in the second quarter that he was done for the day . Jones finishes with three carries for 12 yards . Jay Cohen reporting from Chicago 1:15 p.m. No NFL players protested during the national anthem before early games as the league celebrated Veterans Day weekend by honoring the military . The NFL Players Association had asked all players to observe a two-minute moment of silence before games to honor veterans . Even players who have been protesting most of the season stood for the anthem this week , including the Seahawks Michael Bennett , who stood before Thursday night 's game . Titans receiver Rishard Matthews walked onto the field holding hands with soldiers and stood with teammates for the anthem for the first time since President Donald Trump criticized players for protesting . Former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began the protest movement last season . He remains unsigned and has filed a complaint that team owners colluded against him because of the protests aimed at police brutality against African-Americans and other issues . 12:30 p.m. Who would 've thought the Week 10 schedule would feature just one matchup between two teams with winning records . And surprise , surprise , it 's the Buffalo Bills ( 5-3 ) hosting the New Orleans Saints ( 6-2 ) . Despite an offseason overhaul , Buffalo has matched its best start during its 17-season playoff drought the longest active streak in North America 's four major professional sports . The Bills have n't been 6-3 or better since 1999 , and are 4-0 at home . The Saints have won six straight and are a victory short of matching their longest winning streak since 2011 . New Orleans has a chance to open 7-2 or better for only the seventh time in franchise history , and first since 2013 .

Although multiple insiders have said there s a good chance for a reconciliation despite the duo s split , a source tells PEOPLE that the 19-year-old model left the 35-year-old reality star s home to stay with her father , music icon Lionel Richie . Sofia has moved out of Scott s house , the source explains . She has been living at Lionel s house for the past couple of days . She is looking for her own place . As for how Sofia is adjusting to the breakup , She seems to be doing okay , says the insider . She is surrounding herself with girlfriends and keeping busy . Sofia and Disick s split news on Saturday came after Disick was spotted looking flirty with a mystery woman at Kanye West ‘ s Ye listening party in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , on Thursday night . Disick reportedly told guests that he and Sofia were no longer together , according to TMZ . Another source close to the former couple tells PEOPLE that Sofia ended the relationship after confronting Disick about cheating on her but Lionel condemned the relationship long before Disick s alleged infidelities .

		"paragraph": "SPOILER ALERT : The recap for the Swear episode of The Walking Dead contains storyline and character spoilers . There s good news , and terrible , horrible , no good , very bad news in this sixth episode of The Walking Dead Season 7 : We finally catch up with Tara and Heath hooray but we also learn that Negan and the Saviors are not only way more brutal than we thought , there are also way more of them than we thought . We re Supposed To A young girl named Rachel is quite enthusiastic about stabbing a bloated walker she and an older girl named Cyndie find near the beach . Rachel spots another body on the beach and runs off to make her next kill , but Cyndie yells for her to stop , just before she stabs a woman Tara ! in the head . Tara s still alive , but unconscious , Cyndie points out . We still got ta do it , Rachel insists , but Cyndie says they do n t , not if people do n t find out . Rachel says she s not a snitch , but she s ticked off about not getting to make another kill , so she says she wo n t help Cyndie , either . Cyndie drags Tara s body to a secluded spot on the beach and brings her bottles of water , something wrapped in a cloth , and a spear . When Cyndie walks away , Tara opens her eyes and downs the water . She unwraps the cloth to find a dried fish , and when she spots Cyndie leaving the beach , she grabs the spear and follows her . You Choose You Heath and Tara are still on their supply run in the RV , and Heath is dejected about the fruits of their labor for the last two weeks : eight rusty cans of okra and a bottle of aspirin . Rule No. 1 of scavenging is , there s nothing left in this world that is n t hidden , Tara tries to reassure him . We just have to find it . He s also still wigged out about the attack on the Saviors outpost , and the realization it forced him to make about just how dangerous the world , and people , are outside the walls of Alexandria . If it s you or someone else , you choose you , Heath says , but Tara does n t believe he really means that . They move on to a new location to look for supplies and happen upon a bridge that s been barricaded on one side . It s littered with cars and tents and tarps strung up on wire and a kiddie pool with dead plants in it , as if a group of people had tried to carry out a plan . Heath and Tara spot a giant mountain of sand on the bridge , and just as Heath sees a big pile of spent bullet casings at the bottom of it , Tara pulls something out of the pile that sends the whole thing raining down on them . It also frees dozens of walkers , who are now trying to snack on them . Very quickly , they re each surrounded by walkers , and Heath disappears behind a tarp . Did he really choose you and abandon Tara , who is now being backed into the edge of the bridge by walkers ? As she yells out for her friend , she tumbles over the side of the bridge and into the river below . Where Are All the Men ? Back at the beach , Tara has followed Cyndie through a woodsy area and into a little gathering of cottages . She sees women carrying baskets , kids playing , lookouts on platforms , and things covered in camouflage material . Everyone , mostly adult women , is mostly dressed in drab browns and dark greens , and Tara sees they also have a large storage shed packed with guns of all sizes . Before she can understand what is happening , the women run for the artillery shed and pick up guns , and the first shots are fired at Tara . Luckily for her , they re all pretty terrible shots , and she runs away from them and into a woman with a gun . Tara knocks her down , takes her gun , but does n t shoot her . She runs off again , but this time runs straight into Rachel , the kill-happy tween , who s pointing a gun right at her . Tara drops her spear , but Rachel says , Does n t matter , we re supposed to . Cyndie comes to the rescue again to spare Tara s life , but the whole community of nearly all women has gathered around her , all pointing guns at her . The group s leader , an older woman we ll soon meet as Natania , is listening as Tara tries to explain she meant no harm and will happily be on her way , but the next time we see her , she s handcuffed to a radiator inside an office with a picture on the wall that indicates she s at the Oceanside Cabin Motor Court . Natania , Kathy , and Beatrice ( the woman Tara chose not to shoot earlier ) talk to her , revealing they have a system of bells and air horns they use to keep their hidden community safe . Tara tells them she fell off a bridge , into a river , which carried her to the ocean and the beach . Natania tells her they usually shoot people on sight to further insure their safety , but they paused with her because Cyndie , Natania s granddaughter , likes her , and because she spared Beatrice s life . But if they let her go , they have no guarantee she wo n t run and tell other people about their community . Yeah , that s a pickle all right , Tara replies . Related : ‘ The Walking Dead Star Sonequa Martin-Green Says the Women Want to ‘ Rectify This Wrong That night , Kathy gets Tara from the Oceanside office , and leads her through the woods to another cabin . The table is set for dinner , and Natania asks her if she likes fish , because fish stew is what s on the menu . The table includes Natania , Tara , Beatrice , Kathy , and Cyndie , who explains Rachel to Tara , saying she s never had to kill a living human yet . Cyndie has , and she s a good shot . Dinner begins , and Tara scarfs down the meal so quickly that Kathy asks when she last ate . Natania talks about their endless supply of fish being a perk of living near the ocean and she asks Tara if she d like to stay with them , permanently . Tara could put down roots , she says , and they d be sure their community remains a secret . Tara had told them she s been living in random places since the apocalypse began and that she traveled with a friend , so Natania offers to help find him and let him move into the community too . That prompts a question . I never thought I d be asking this , but where are all the men ? Tara asks , and when all the women bow their heads , she continues , All of them ? Natania explains they got into a skirmish with another group of survivors , and they lost all their men , as well as Cyndie s mom and 11-year-old brother . After that , we decided to protect ourselves no matter what , Natania says . No matter who we crossed , we would kill on sight . We left our old home with just the clothes on our backs . And then we found this place . We would stay hidden . And we would stay alive . She goes on to say she knows Tara probably thinks they re monsters , but she hopes their honesty will spark Tara to be honest with them . She had previously also told them she worked on a fishing boat , which they knew was a lie . So she comes clean about living in a community , with walls , where she has a girlfriend that she s anxious to return to . ( Oh , no , we forgot … she does n t know about Denise , or Glenn , or Abraham ) . She tells them , without sharing the name of the group , that her people have also done things to survive , taking out a whole group of survivors who lived at a satellite station . The look that passes among the other women suggests they know exactly who she s talking about . Tara suggests the Oceanside community could team up with her community , an idea that s immediately shot down . Tara tells them they ca n t go on forever assuming everyone is their enemy . Sooner or later , you re gon na need a friend , she tells them . Cyndie tries to agree with Tara , but her grandmother cuts her off . All Natania will agree to is sending someone with Tara to find Heath and continue on to her community to scope it out . The next day , Tara leaves , with Beatrice and Kathy , to head back to the bridge where she last saw Heath . People getting together … that s how the world s gon na be the world again , Tara says to Natania on her way out . But the trip turns deadly , quickly , as the women lead Tara through the woods and start shooting at her . She runs away , but Beatrice catches up with her and points her gun right at Tara , tearfully telling her she has nothing left , that the group her friends attacked , the Saviors , have already killed them . Tara says no , her people killed the entire outpost , but Beatrice says there are more Saviors and more outposts . She tells Tara they ca n t be stopped they lined up all the men and all the boys who were older than 10 and shot them in the head . And we tried to fight , just like you , Beatrice says . They won . Finally , one night the women and children still alive left , running away to the eventual safety of Oceanside . We are not gon na let you lead them back to us , Beatrice tells Tara , just as she s about to kill her . Cyndie interrupts to save Tara s life for a third time , and she gives her a backpack of food and water , and a spear , and says she ll lead her back to the bridge . They get there , and Cyndie stays to help Tara survive the walkers and get to the other end of the bridge . Just as Tara makes it , she looks back to see Kathy and Beatrice have arrived to drag Cyndie back home . Tara then remembers what really happened at the bridge before her trip down the river to Oceanside . Heath had briefly disappeared behind a tarp , but came right back to help her out of her walker jam . She yells to him that she s coming to help him he s surrounded by them too and then she tells him they re in this together . I know , he yells , before she goes into the water . Now back at the scene , Tara walks along the road and spots Heath s broken glasses on the ground . Next to them , she sees there are what looks like fresh tire tracks in the grass . Maybe that was you , she mumbles . Then she spots something in the grass , a white security badge or pass with the letters PPP written on it . I hope that was you , she says . We Can Square This Tara heads towards home , walking through fields , and seeking temporary refuge in an old boat and in a gift shop . She eats more of that salted dry perch Cyndie packed into the go bag for her , and finds that her new friend also included a present : a bracelet made of seashells . Finally , Tara is walking down the road just outside the Alexandria gates , smiling , wearing a pair of bright sunglasses she got at the gift shop . Eugene spots her through binoculars , and by the time he opens the gates to greet her , he s crying , as the bearer of so much heartbreaking news . Sitting on the floor in Denise s medical office , Tara is playing with a doctor bobblehead when Rosita tells her she s sorry . Tara tells her the same thing , and then an angry Rosita tells her they do n t have to just sit there . She wants to square things , and she wonders if Tara has any leads on where they can replenish their gun supply . She does n t care how dangerous the acquisition would be , Rosita says . We can make this right . We have to . We ca n t , Tara answers . I did n t see anything like that out there . Zombie Bites : * In TWD comics , there s a group of survivors who live near the beach in Virginia , and their community is referred to as Oceanside . Readers have yet to see the community or its residents , and they re introduced in issue 139 ( the most recent issue released is 160 ) , which puts them at a different point in the comic s timeline than we re currently at in the show ( not that that means anything … mashups ) . What we do know is that , as Natania and her people do , the Oceansiders in the comics also live off the ocean , and they eventually become a part of the trading system that includes Alexandria , the Hilltop , the Kingdom , and the Sanctuary . * Nobody s evil , they just decide to forget who they are , Cyndie tells Tara , who assures her , Some people are evil , Cyndie . I ve seen it . * That instrumental song playing as Tara makes her way back to Alexandria : Dirty Three s Everything s F ***** . Sounds about right . * The Oceanside crew refers to walkers as bobbers . * Is Heath dead or alive ? Those tire tracks near his broken glasses suggest he might have been taken , but ultimately , the answer to his fate might be tied to actor Corey Hawkins s availability and the success of the 24 : Legacy reboot he s starring in on Fox in February . * Natania tells Tara she and her people fled from the Saviors with nothing but the clothes on their backs . So how and where did they get that big cache of guns ? OK , Dead-heads , let s hear your reactions to Swear . Our questions : Why did n t Tara tell Rosita about the Oceanside community and their big supply of guns ? Is she trying to protect the Oceanside women , or protect Rosita from making a dangerous mission to procure those weapons for Alexandria ? How long do you think it ll be until we inevitably see those Oceanside women again ? Were you surprised about this new intel on just how widespread the Saviors murderous ways are ? And what do you think happened to Heath ? The Walking Dead airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on AMC .",

However , I think there 's something more to the price move than simply optimism over Culp . Let 's take a closer look . In a nutshell , GE has done a terrible job of turning itself around and managing investor expectations , and the news that there 's a clean sweep at the top is hopefully going to lead to a change in how the company manages its affairs . Although it 's hard not to feel sympathy for Flannery -- he was dealt a rotten hand -- he was responsible for a large part of the mess . The skepticism over the commitment to a clean sweep was fueled right at the start of Flannery 's tenure . In a move that can only be described as bizarre , the first thing GE did after appointing Flannery was to give then-CFO Jeff Bornstein a promotion to vice chairman . If that were n't strange enough , a few months later it was announced that Bornstein would be leaving . Flannery then appeared to take charge of events . He decided to ignore the calls to separate the healthcare business , but yielded to the inevitability of a dividend cut and reduced GE 's dividend by half to $ 0.48 . GE 's turnaround strategy was then set in place in November 2017 . Flannery intended to shore up the balance sheet by exiting $ 20 billion worth of assets , while relying on the earnings and cash flow from the aviation and healthcare segments to tide the company over while restructuring a power segment ailing from weakening end markets . EPS and free cash flow ( FCF ) guidance for 2018 were set at $ 1 - $ 1.07 , and $ 6 billion - $ 7 billion , respectively . Flannery 's plan might have sounded good , but it was n't decisive enough . Worse , the plan was beset with risk from the start . For example , consider the new dividend of $ 0.48 per share . Paying the dividend would require roughly $ 4.2 billion in cash , but management was only forecasting $ 6 billion - $ 7 billion in FCF . Meanwhile , GE 's substantial pension deficit needed funding , and based on GE 's figures , it needed $ 2 billion in 2018 alone . In fact , GE borrowed $ 6 billion in order to pre-fund its pension for three years . And without the extra debt , the dividend would only barely ( or possibly not ) have been funded from FCF . Not to mention that the underlying available FCF ( free cash flow minus pension funding and dividend ) was going to be peanuts compared to what management needed to turn the power business around . Moreover , in terms of the dividend , the plan had little margin for safety and needed a combination of blemish-free execution and some stabilization in the power segment 's end markets . GE got neither . Fast-forward from the November 2017 reset , and January started with a $ 6.2 billion tax charge relating to its insurance portfolio . February saw CFO Jamie Miller lowering 2018 earnings expectations to the lower end of the $ 1 - $ 1.07 range at an investor conference , due to weakening power markets . GE also progressively lowered expectations for gas turbine sales in 2018 . The first-quarter results in April saw GE 's management lower power-segment earnings guidance by a whopping $ 500 million ( worth around $ 0.05 in EPS ) , but there was still no change to the official EPS and FCF guidance . The end of June brought the conclusion of Flannery 's strategic review , and finally , the decision was made to create a stand-alone healthcare company while separating the remaining stake in Baker Hughes , a GE Company . It was a bid to shore up the balance sheet and reduce debt-to-earnings to commonly accepted levels . And still , no cut to the official guidance . July brought a disappointing set of second-quarter earnings , with Miller lowering 2018 FCF to $ 6 billion -- a figure at the bottom , but still within , the original guidance range . There was still no change to the EPS guidance , despite the fact that hardly any Wall Street analyst believed GE would hit even the low end of its EPS guidance range . Moreover , power-segment conditions continued to deteriorate , and GE 's earnings guidance looked increasingly untenable , not least because its key rival , Siemens , was busy lowering earnings and margin expectations for its own power segment . Larry Culp is charged with returning GE to former glories . Image source : Getty Images . The optimism over Culp 's executive abilities is well placed . His first act is likely to be restoration of confidence that GE 's management has a handle on restructuring the company for the long term . That starts with being realistic with guidance and the sustainability of the dividend . In the end , Flannery ended his tenure as Jeff Immelt before him did : stubbornly clinging to guidance that was unlikely to be met , at a time when investors needed to be confident in the direction of the company . Culp just might be the man to turn things around on that front . More From The Motley Fool Lee Samaha has no position in any of the stocks mentioned .

		"paragraph": "A closer is a luxury for a losing major-league baseball club . And say whatever you want about the San Diego Padres , they seem to grasp this . The Padres have n t made the playoffs since 2006 , and the Friars have n t even had a winning record since 2010 . They re currently buried in the NL West standings , 14.5 games out . It s an extensive rebuild here . It s a long road to relevance . With that in mind , Thursday s trade of left-handed reliever Brad Hand made sense . San Diego shipped Hand , its closer , to the Indians . Righty reliever Adam Cimber also packs for Cleveland , while the Padres get a sparkling catching prospect in Francisco Mejia . [ Yahoo Fantasy Football leagues are open : Sign up now for free ] Hand was n t just the Padres closer the last two years , he was the team s best player in 2017 ( 2.16 ERA , 0.93 WHIP , 21 saves , 2.9 bWAR ) . He s been less effective in the surface stats this year ( 3.05 ERA , 1.09 WHIP ) though his FIP is about the same . He s already rung up 24 handshakes in 2018 . Hand s role could go a number of ways in Cleveland . Cody Allen is ostensibly the closer there , though he did have an ugly six-run appearance shortly before the All-Star break . Hand could see some traditional save opportunities , perhaps specific matchup save work , or maybe just work as a rover before the ninth inning , the old Andrew Miller role . And of course , the Tribe is also waiting on the original Miller ( knee ) he s expected to return early in the second half . No matter the names , Cleveland certainly needed bullpen upgrades . The Tribe has a 5.28 ERA in relief only Kansas City is worse . Kirby Yates is the key reliever left standing in the Padres bullpen , and for the moment he s the fantasy guy to get , the expected closer . He s been San Diego s most valuable bWAR man this year , a virtual lawnmower ( 1.43 ERA , 0.88 WHIP , 48 K against 11 BB over 37.2 innings ) . But Yates is also 31 , and remember what we said up front a closer is a luxury for a non-contender . Perhaps Yates will be traded later this month , too ( the Yankees were linked to Hand and Yates before the All-Star break ) . The Padres should at least try to shop every non-essential piece . As dominant as Yates has been this year , he s a journeyman reliever with a career 4.13 ERA and 1.22 WHIP . San Diego would be cashing in , theoretically , at the best time . With Hand and Cimber gone , and Yates perhaps on the block too , proactive save-chasers might want to think about Craig Stammen . Another journeyman , the 34-year-old Stammen has a 2.91 ERA and 1.17 WHIP , with better than a strikeout per inning . Perhaps he d get a chance in the ninth if Yates ca n t handle the job , or is traded later this summer .

They were winning games , but it was n't super convincing and when your biggest concern through 25 % of the season is your franchise quarterback , people are going to be skeptical . The best cure for apathy ? To stay , try throwing 6 TDs and throttling Tampa Bay by 38 points . That opened some people 's eyes , and the Power Rankings that come rolling in this week are reflecting that . Here 's what they 're saying : Ours - # 10 , up 1 : Trubisky !

		"paragraph": "As scores of irritating autoplay videos in your Facebook ( FB ) newsfeed may have told you , video is the hottest thing in digital publishing right now . It s not hard to see why : A video playing on a computer or mobile device typically has a captive audience , and the advertisement that comes before it ca n t be scrolled and ignored past like a banner . For advertisers , it s like applying the Ludovico technique from A Clockwork Orange a guarantee of a successful ad view . In the industry s more and more quixotic quest for sustainable monetization , video investment has skyrocketed , buoyed by Facebook prioritization of video content , a convenient delivery system in the post-homepage era . For example BuzzFeed , a bellwether of digital media trends , recently performed a second reorganization this year , steering its ship strongly towards video . As its CEO Jonah Peretti wrote at the time , As digital video becomes ubiquitous , every major initiative at BuzzFeed around the world will find an expression as video . This pretty much reflects the views of most publications today including this one . Of late , however , video has taken on bubble-like qualities , and in the past few weeks two facts have emerged that suggest the walls of the bubble are getting thinner not just big as the social media feeds suggest . To start off , Facebook has defined a video view since at least 2014 as a view of three seconds or more . ( A video play is the solicited version , where the user clicks on the video . ) Though this is n t really different from a traditional banner ad conversion standard , the meager number garnered attention last month when the Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook had artificially inflated video views by 60 % -80 % . That we are experiencing a boom in online video is indisputable the numbers have been staggering but it might not be quite as sweet as reported . The digital content video boom suffered a second hit , this week , when a Pew survey found that younger adults the millennials advertisers spend billions wooing prefer text to video when consuming news , a big part of digital publishing . In fact , the only demographics that preferred watching news were people 50 or older , and they tended to watch on TV , not online , by an overwhelming margin of 88 % to 4 % ( a few did not discriminate , apparently . ) Across all ages , the younger the demographic the more people preferred reading news over watching it . Though 46 % of Americans prefer watching news , the number fell to 38 % among people 18 to 29 . ( Of this young , tech savvy demographic , 42 % prefer reading it and online . ) Given the advertising industry s affinity for surveying , this revelation ca n t really be a surprise , so it may not end up being the pencil that pops the Bubblicious , but it certainly jives with some basic facts about video . Lest we forget , videos ask far more than any other type of content ( for now , until VR booms ) . Time-crunched or impatient viewers ca n t skim a video quickly as they might a listicle the previous big craze in digital publishing ushered in by Buzzfeed . Additionally , while viewers can now watch and understand a video without sound thanks to subtitles , they manifest more as an attention grabbing technique to get viewers to unmute than a viable audio substitute for someone looking to consume content without headphones . The list of potential reasons Pew survey respondents might like to keep their news in written form goes on and on . It s hard to save videos for later , there s an increased data demand , it drains battery faster , it freezes computers , it has awful and distracting music , it ca n t hyperlink to sources and relevant content , and it means you have to go out of your way to hit the pause or mute buttons . Of course , video s imposition and demands from the consumer is one of the key reasons why advertisers will pay publishers more for it it s way harder to ignore . This is n t to say video is n t as effective as text as a means to communicate information or entertain . With today s technological capabilities and viewer demand , it only makes sense to invest in video . But if the media industry wants to remain stable it needs to recognize that while it may be okay to be mobile or video first , there s a good chance it wo n t work out if you re not consumer-first and know when to stick with good old text .

		"paragraph": "Michael Cohen , President Donald Trump 's former lawyer , is under investigation for bank and tax fraud , and investigators are looking at more than $ 20 million in loans to a taxi company he owns with his family , The New York Times reported on Sunday . The value of those scrutinized loans had not been previously reported . The report , which cited multiple sources familiar with the matter , said authorities are additionally looking into whether the former fixer broke any laws by arranging financial deals with women claiming to have had affairs with Trump . The Times said two of its sources indicated that prosecutors could file charges by the end of August . Lanny Davis , a lawyer for Cohen , did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment about the report from the Times . The newspaper said Cohen and his lawyers declined to comment for its article . The bank fraud portion of the investigation centers on whether Cohen misrepresented the value of his holdings in order to secure loans from two New York lenders , Sterling National Bank and the Melrose Credit Union , the report said . The Times added that there 's no indication Cohen missed payments or caused losses to either financial institution , which , according to the paper , is usually part of a bank fraud charge . Politics watchers are tracking Cohen 's case because he could potentially reach an agreement with prosecutors that would offer him leniency in exchange for his cooperating with Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller 's probe into whether the Trump campaign was involved with Russian attempts to skew the 2016 U.S. presidential race .

		"paragraph": "In a statement , Atlanta Hawks swingman Thabo Sefolosha said as much as he could , and said plenty enough in response to the ongoing investigation behind the season-ending injury he suffered while being arrested at the scene of Chris Copeland s stabbing earlier this month : Sefolosha , who suffered a broken right fibula and torn ligaments , then addressed the media as best he could while under legal advisement : Lest you think Thabo is running away from the injury was caused by the police , he also added this aside in talking to the media : The video , unearthed by TMZ just hours after it was announced Sefolosha would be out for the season , appears to show an NYPD officer striking the Hawks swingman with a baton after he had been wrestled to the ground . It was originally reported that Sefolosha and teammate Pero Antic were close to Copeland we he was stabbed , but ESPN.com s Kevin Arnovitz reported on Tuesday that the two Hawk reserves appear to be more than 100 feet from the site of Copeland 's stabbing . The NYPD Internal Affairs bearau , according to Arnovitz s report , will be contacting Sefolosha to interview him as a complaining witness . [ Follow Dunks Do n't Lie on Tumblr : The best slams from all of basketball ] In case you re diving in to pass judgment on the Hawks being out at that hour with a game scheduled for that night , understand that these two are widely beloved by the Hawks as teammates , with no previous history of rabble-rousing . This is what made the initial police report one that stated Sefolosha decided to charge at a row of police all the more surprising . There is also this : Sefolosha told media that his Hawk teammates have been very supportive . From Chris Vivlamore s piece at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution : Sefolosha and Antic were out at a club just hours after flying into New York City from Atlanta on a Tuesday night , and just hours before the team ( already assured with the top seed in the Eastern Conference ) was set to take on the Brooklyn Nets that Wednesday evening . This is what basketball players sometimes do . Their 9-to-5 starts at 5 at night , and it s hard to turn down a chance to go to a club in New York with a potential two-month playoff slog upcoming . As far as the police investigation and Sefolosha s personal case go , we just hope the NYPD will allow some shred of transparency after what appears to be a rather dubious ( to put it mildly ) start to things . - - - - - - - Kelly Dwyer is an editor for Ball Do n't Lie on Yahoo Sports .

		"paragraph": "Spoiler alert : If you have n't watched the Feb. 10 episode of Justified \" The Trash and the Snake , \" written by Chris Provenzano and Ingrid Escajeda and directed by Adam Arkin stop reading now . As he 'll do throughout the season , showrunner Graham Yost takes Yahoo TV inside the writers ' room to discuss the twists and turns and tease where we 're headed . We have to start with the return of Dickie Bennett ( Emmy winner Jeremy Davies ) , which was a great surprise . How did you decide to bring him back ? Well , we knew that we wanted someone else who appears in the episode , our lovely Loretta McCready [ played by Kaitlyn Dever ] . She came out of the weed business the Bennetts were in the weed business . We all felt it was part and parcel of what Markham is in town to do , and so we liked the idea of Loretta putting down stakes and saying she 's taking the money that she got from Mags and she 's going to get in that business . The primo land would be the Bennett land we just liked the idea of her snaking that land out from under Dickie and what his reaction would be . The whole thing is just for him to howl in pain , \" Loretta ! \" I had to rewind his entrance , when he rolled in and said , \" What up , pimps ? \" to Raylan and Gutterson . As a viewer , you ca n't wait to see what Jeremy 's going to do with a monologue : where he 'll take his pauses , the sounds that he 'll make , the hand gestures . Is it the same for the cast and crew ? All that stuff , yeah . Other actors just have to wait till he stops talking before they can say their line . He has inhabited this Dickieness that is so insane , that is entirely hard to predict what you 're going to get , but you know it will be spontaneous and interesting and absolutely ca n't take your eyes off him . Related : Graham Yost Talks ' Noblesse Oblige , ' Avery 's Warning , and Wynn 's Tanning Bed It was great to have Gutterson there to witness the Dickie show , and Raylan 's \" Archangel \" bit , which also made it feel different than Raylan 's last visit to see Dickie . It 's just great to have Raylan and Gutterson together at any time because they 're on the same side , but they 're also giving each other s -- t. Jacob is such a simply comic actor that it 's great to have him react , then pan to the crazy shenanigans . Just the notion of Dickie going off on this thing of visions and then Raylan just playing into it . Who 's responsible for that Gutterson line in an earlier scene about him preferring to die by having Sigourney Weaver choke him out with her thighs ? Absolutely Jacob [ Pitts ] , and wonderful , because back in the day , when I lived in New York , I knew Sigourney through friends . People will think I put that in there , but that was just Jacob . Another surprise people will definitely be talking about is Wiz ( guest star Jake Busey ) blowing up . What was the inspiration for that moment , which , like Picker 's death last season , was hilarious ? I 'll take some credit . I just said , \" Would n't it be cool if Duffy and Boyd go on a test mission to see how to get into a vault like that ? \" Duffy , having come up through the security business , would know people who knew how to break into safes . So then Ingrid came up with the character of the Wiz , and the whole notion of him calling himself the Wiz . And then we got Jake Busey , which sort of added a whole level to it just this guy who is so cocky and self-important and grandiose . We just liked the idea of him blowing up . I mean , it was as simple as that . There 's nothing any grander than that . When they were shooting this sort of mortar full of fake guts and blood at Walton [ Goggins ] and Jere [ Burns ] , Adam Arkin asked them to keep their eyes open . Some got in Jere 's eye , but he 's a pro , and he just really struggled to keep his eyes open even though this stuff was flying at their faces . I think at the end of the series , we could put together a little reel of Wynn Duffy reacting to horrible , horrible violence . [ Laughs . ] He has blood sprayed on him in Season 4 when he 's sitting in his motor coach and Nicky Augustine shoots the corrupt FBI guy . That 's just part of Wynn 's burden . The one thing that got cut out is , we had a follow-on scene where Boyd and Duffy go back to the Wiz 's house to clean up , because they got the guts on them , and in comes Bridget [ the girl with the snake ] , who was named in honor of Bridget Fonda , who was in Jackie Brown . She realizes the Wiz is dead , and she 's furious , and Duffy gives her $ 10,000 to shut up , and he says , \" And I mean , shut up . I mean you do n't talk to anyone , and you stop talking now . \" And she says , \" Well , this is the start , \" and he shoots her in the head . \" I told you to stop talking . \" One of the things that was going to come out in the scene was that it was her who had called the Wiz and rang his cell phone , which set off the explosives . We liked the idea of the Wiz being truly hoisted on his own petard which , by the way , a petard was a grenade of some sort way back when . So he blows up on his own . We shot it , and we just felt that with the propulsion of the episode , it just was n't necessary . Part of it was , we wanted to re-establish Duffy 's badassery , but you know , you 've had Jere Burns , you do n't need to re-establish that . Related : Graham Yost Talks ' Cash Game , ' Sam Elliott , and a Twist Straight Out of Harlan Getting back to Raylan , he and Avery finally came face-to-face at Loretta 's , after it 's clear to viewers that Walker and the rest of Markham 's men are willing to kill to get the best land for their weed business and Loretta has no intention of selling . Tim Olyphant likes to joke that he 's been doing Sam Elliott for years , just not as cool . How much excitement was there around that scene ? Tim came out of that scene and was just eyes wide and grinning and I could tell that by talking to him on the phone . He just said , \" More Sam Elliott . \" He just wanted scenes with him , and that 's basically what everyone said from Episode 3 , where Joelle [ Carter ] got to play a long scene with him and then Walton did . Everyone just gets a real kick out of playing opposite him . He was born to do an Elmore Leonard bad guy . Having Raylan and Avery meet was a specific target for the episode . We knew we wanted Raylan to get there to kind of be saving Loretta , because Loretta is sort of the client of our series after Season 2 , in a way . We 're always rooting for her . We also wanted to show her having some grit on her own and that she is sort of unflappable at this point . So those were the goals , and then you just add Gutterson in there to be funny and have him stand on his gun . That 's the fun of doing this show : You know you 're going to get those characters all together . Do n't screw it up , you got a shot at a good scene . Will we see Loretta again this season ? You know , listen , Loretta is embarking on being a player in the weed business hoping it goes legal , and Markham wants the same thing . That 's all I 'll say . How did you land on this legal weed business storyline for the final season ? We researched it . There 's two things : One is , like every state in the union , there 's obviously someone pushing a bill for medical . That has n't gotten a lot of traction there , but we 'll see within the next five years what happens nationally . It could slide back and Colorado could repeal , and Washington could , too , but more and more , the public sentiment is in favor . It 's just , \" Oh , come on , what are we doing ? Why are we spending all this money trying to stop something that 's a hell of a lot less dangerous than alcohol , in terms of lives lost and stuff ? \" So we just sort of feel that 's where the nation is headed . However , the other thing about Kentucky is , it was the number one hemp growing region in the world at one point , and then when hemp got lumped in with marijuana , that all fell by the wayside . So there is this Kentucky tradition of hemp and , to a certain degree , cannabis . This episode really tightened the screws on Ava . Her meeting Raylan in the stairwell of the hotel was almost more nerve-wracking than Raylan , Boyd , and Picker 's stairway conversation in \" Decoy . \" And that stairwell was actually in the power plant where they blew up the Wiz . That 's just the nature of the game . It 's like , \" Oh , we need a stairwell somewhere . \" \" Oh , this one will do . We can put that with that day . Somebody just puts some signs on the wall and have an extra as a maid . \" We wanted the danger of it , of them actually meeting in the place where all these bad guys are . Ava asks Raylan if holding someone 's fate in his hand is a burden or what gets him out of bed in the morning . That 's a question we 'll return to a lot this season ? Well , you know , the last scene of Season 5 was Ava saying , \" I 'm scared , \" and Raylan saying , \" You 're going to be fine . \" So he does hold her fate in his hands . He can play pretty casual about her , turn it around and say , \" You 've got nothing to worry about \" but Raylan 's a hero . We never lose sight of that . Related : Graham Yost Talks Premiere Shocker Katherine Hale ( Mary Steenburgen ) decided to spend the day with Ava . You get the feeling Katherine is waiting for Ava to screw up , and yet , in the car ride after their heist of the tennis bracelet , it 's Katherine who looks momentarily uncomfortable after sharing that the jewelry store owner now locks the door on her when he used to meet her at it with champagne . What did you want to accomplish with that scene ? We did n't want it to reveal too much , but just a glimpse into what life post-Grady has been like for Katherine . That she 's done OK , but she has certainly descended from the heights of where they had been and it is not something that she is happy about . There 's actually one little bit where she just says , \" S -- t , \" and it was actually the tail end of a take where something happened in the traffic or something , and that was just Mary saying , \" S -- t. \" But we liked it so much that we put it into the show . One thing about the jewelry store scene : the jeweler , Winston , you recognize him ? That is David Brisbin , and he played Mr. Ernst , who owned and operated the Bar None Ranch on Hey Dude [ the Nickelodeon show where Yost started his career ] . And Dave and I have remained close friends since 1989 , and I always try to get him in [ my shows ] somewhere . He 's just a great actor , very funny . He had a big part in Boomtown . And I will say one other thing , the stolen tennis bracelet that [ Katherine ] swapped out plays a role in the rest of the season . Now I 'm already thinking ... is she going to frame Ava ? No . Nothing like that . You 'll see . We found out two other things about Katherine this episode : that she believes Avery ratted on her husband , and that 's why she 's determined to steal from him , and that she knows about Albert ( Danny Strong ) , the guard whose change of heart Ava needs everyone to believe resulted in her release . They tried to cross the T 's and dot the I 's on the story of how Ava got released , but Albert is the weak link in the story and that 's a big part of the next episode . So we 'll see Danny Strong again ? Yes , and it was hard to get him because he was directing an episode of [ Fox 's ] Empire , which is his show . But we managed to get him , so we were very lucky , and it was fun to hang with him . The episode ends with Ava wanting desperately to leave , and Boyd telling her , \" No , we 're going to steal Markham 's money and his idea and be the weed kings of Harlan . \" So first , you 're like , poor Ava . But then you 're thinking how both Raylan and Boyd want to bring down Markham . A lot of fans will hope they 'll find themselves on the same side again , at some point . We have a strange dynamic in this show in that we 've got a hero and a villain , Raylan and Boyd , but in order to have story , we also have to bring in someone else , and you need that other person to have conflict with both Raylan and Boyd . So you can start to think that Raylan and Boyd can be on the same side , but they 're not on the same side . So that poses challenges for us writing the show , but it 's also where a lot of our meat comes because they 're not in alignment . And yeah , that was a big goal for this episode , the idea that from the first episode of this season , Boyd has been saying , \" Let 's go . \" So finally , when Ava says , \" Let 's go , \" Boyd says , \" You have to hold on a second I want to stay . \" The ramifications of that are what the next episode is about . Raylan also paid Art ( Nick Searcy ) another visit this episode . Most people think of Raylan as invincible , but Art seems to always be there to remind us that Raylan can get bit in the ass , too . Was that the goal of that scene ? It was a couple of things . Raylan says , \" I just want to get Boyd and go , \" and then along comes Avery Markham , and he says the story about his mother and the trash and the snake , which became the title of the episode : You see a snake , you do n't just come back and say you saw a snake you take care of it . So he 's a lawman , and he feels he needs to take care of Avery Markham and look into this . And our [ technical ] advisor says , \" Yeah , anyone you come across , you 're interested , and you 're asking around . You 're trying to find out how do they play ? Can this case be even bigger than we thought ? \" But the other side of that is , does Raylan really want to leave ? Because if you keep on finding excuses to do other stuff , and you take your eyes off your main goal , does n't that sort of say that at some level , maybe even on a primarily unconscious level maybe you do n't want to leave ? So , now we 've got Boyd saying at the end of the episode , \" I want to stay , \" Ava saying she wants to leave , and Raylan both saying he wants to leave and acting like he wants to stay . That 's sort of , in many ways , the point of the episode . There 's one other thing in that scene with Art , when they bring up the whole idea of who ratted out Grady Hale ? Who killed Vasquez 's boss ? Who killed Grady in prison ? All these questions of 14 years ago , and Art is a bored man recooperating on medical leave and he says , basically , \" If I get too bored , maybe I 'll sniff around . \" That also becomes part of the next few episodes . You 're shooting the series finale this week . How are you feeling about it ? We feel pretty good about it . It 's not going to satisfy everyone , but I think it will satisfy a lot of people , and again , our primary goal , in absentia , posthumously , we 're trying to please Elmore . What would he have done ? At the end of the day , if he went , \" Yeah , that was the right way to end it \" that 's been our goal .

		"paragraph": "Warning : Spoilers ahead for the Off Brand episode of Better Call Saul . Christmas in July ? How about Christmas in May , which is what this gem of an episode of Better Call Saul feels like : the first time we see Jimmy identify himself as Saul Goodman … Gus is checking out the industrial laundromat that will eventually become Walter White s underground meth lab … Chuck McGill is open to getting mental health help … and Lydia , one of the masterminds of Gus s international drug cartel , is introduced to the Saul universe in one of the biggest surprises of the season . With Season 3 officially more than halfway to the finale just four episodes remain Yahoo TV talked to series co-creator Peter Gould about the joys of star wipes , how Jimmy will spend his next year of non-lawyering ( after the bar hearing ended with a one-year suspension ) , what this means for Jimmy and Kim , the sincerity of Chuck s attempts to get control of his health , and how the guy we might have initially seen as the least trustworthy has turned out to be the only person Chuck trusts right now . We see Saul for the first time ! Yeah , definitely a version of Saul . At the beginning of the season , we talked about what we could say about the season and Bob [ Odenkirk ] said to someone , You re going to see Saul Goodman , but not how you expect necessarily . Instead of Saul Goodman the sleazy lawyer , we see Saul Goodman the wannabe television director . Whatever he is there at the end of the episode , he is certainly a new guy . And that guy says one of the funniest lines of the season . When Jimmy / Saul tells Kim the guy at the TV station said he s never seen so many star wipes in a row … it sums up what Jimmy would be as a filmmaker , I think , so well . He wants to say something is unique . That line , and I m so glad you like it , that came out of a suggestion of Bob s actually , because he mentioned to Ann Cherkis , the writer of the episode , after he read a draft , after any filmmaking project , the filmmaker will say , Nobody has ever done a steady-cam shot that goes underwater like this … [ everyone ] always has to try to say there is a first , so Ann dreamt up this line and decided it would be star wipes . Of course , when we posted the commercial , Kelley Dixon , our editor , had to go against her excellent good taste and add more star wipes … I think the largest number of star wipes I ve ever seen in a row , that s for sure . It hurt her to do it , though , I m sure . I m guessing she was holding her nose . She had a great sense of humor , and it s one of the joys of doing the show is that we re all building on each other s work , so it s really fun . The more serious part of that , though , and it s absolutely something you would assume that Jimmy would come up with , is that he finds this way to not only not lose out on his ad money , but he finds this new project for himself . There are so many times throughout the series when you think about Jimmy and just say , He could do anything . There are so many things he could be doing successfully with his skills , his personality , his intelligence . Sales and advertising absolutely seems like something that he would not only be great at , but that he would probably love doing , especially in this capacity . Obviously , we always have to keep in mind that we know where he ends up in the Breaking Bad universe , but is this year-long suspension from being a lawyer going to open up the possibility of him looking at other things that he would be happier doing , that he would be more successful doing even , if he were just free of Chuck and trying to live up to Chuck s expectations ? What a great question . Certainly , I do n t want to give anything away , but I ll speak for myself . We had two different reactions when we realized that Jimmy would be suspended for a year . One was joy , because it gives us so many possibilities , and like you say , Jimmy has so many abilities , and probably his greatest superpower is his ability to bounce back . When you knock him down , he pops back up , and there is something wonderful about that . He s so creative , and he has so much energy , it opens up a whole world to us . But it also means that for a year he s not going to be a lawyer , and that means that we have to do a lot of thinking . Jimmy does , too , because even though he s not going to be a lawyer for a year , he has this office with Kim , and that seems to be really central to him . We found out way back in Season 1 that having an office with Kim and being next to her , being with her , is one of the most important things in his life . If he s not going to be a lawyer , as we find out in this episode , what is going to happen to that office ? Jimmy is deeply determined and almost energized because he does not want to lose what he gained last season . He does not want to lose that relationship with Kim . He does not want to lose that feeling that he s got . For whatever reason , being side by side with her … I do n t think I m giving anything away when I say he loves her , and we ve realized as we ve gone forward that she may be the love of his life . He feels that this office is something that is very important , that they ve built together . How far is he going to go to defend that is one of the questions we asked ourselves . That brings up another charming thing about Jimmy : He s not really thinking about money and never really has in terms of , as Jimmy anyway , accumulating it . It s what it can do for him . Right now , as you said , his main concern really is being able to keep that office and stay with Kim . He does n t care that he does n t have the Davis & Main car and all those things anymore . He just , right now , needs to make enough money to keep that office going . I think he would live there as long as it meant he could stay with Kim . I think you re right . We have an interesting thing about our show … Jimmy and Mike both , we have two people who are on the edge of criminality , but neither one seems to care all that much about money by itself . Neither one of them is a classically greedy person . Jimmy may be greedy for attention , but that is a little bit different . I agree with you . I find that fascinating . It often causes us all kinds of … I do n t want to say it causes us problems , but it makes us think more deeply about the characters , to think about what motivates them and why they take the steps that they do . And that s one of the things I find fascinating about Mike as well as Jimmy . Mike , we meet on Breaking Bad and he s living in that same little house , the same one that he is apparently able to rent or own with his income from retirement as a police officer and working in a parking booth . He has n t really changed his lifestyle when he [ becomes ] right-hand man to a drug lord . You know that something else is motivating him , and one of the fascinating things that we re exploring on the show is , of course , how Mike Ehrmantraut becomes Gus Fring s right-hand man . There are a couple of other big things that happen . Gus … Lydia … we see him checking out the industrial laundry facility for the first time . This episode is packed with these monumental Saul/Breaking Bad universe events . Who expected to see Lydia at this point ? Yeah . And we get to see the chicken farm and Lydia in one long sequence , and the laundry , too . It was so much fun for us to bring back Laura Fraser . Vince [ Gilligan ] and I called her at home in Scotland to explain what we were hoping for , and of course , Laura is a wonderful actress , and she also has the most beautiful Scottish accent when she is speaking as Laura Fraser before she transforms herself into Lydia . She is a find , and I think there is so much more to say about Lydia Rodarte . I m fascinated by seeing her also with Gus , and when we knew her on Breaking Bad … we never met her until after Gus was dead , and the whole operation was in terrible danger . Now we re seeing her a little bit more optimistic about how this whole venture is going to go . She is obviously aiding and abetting Gus in buying this laundry facility . Of course , it is another wonderful moment if you caught it … Giancarlo [ Esposito ] was actually shining a flashlight underneath the washing machines , which later on Breaking Bad , of course , is moved to reveal the secret stairway that will take them down to the super lab . He is already scouting out where he s going to put that lab , so he s got a plan . That s for sure . We re really seeing the very beginning of that whole huge , international operation at this point . Yes , we are . We were talking earlier about Jimmy and his affection for Kim . I love the scene where they re celebrating their bar hearing victory . You and I have talked about this before … their romance is a very classic , old movie romance , and this is a small glimpse into the more physical romance . She has her feet crossed over his . She s leaning her head on this shoulder . She cups his face with her hand . He makes that joke about rolling around on the floor on her notes . It s fun to get that from them , right after she has given this summation that really does highlight all the wonderful parts of Jimmy , how caring he is , especially for people who are underserved or neglected . Was it intentional to give us that little moment when we know that things are probably going to go wrong again soon ? Absolutely . Kim really has thrown her lot in with Jimmy , and she does not lie in that hearing . But she knows that there are omissions , and she also knows , even though Chuck was angry and losing his temper and motivated by all kinds of terrible things … a lot of what Chuck said was true , and she knows it . She knows it damn well . Kim has thrown her lot in with Jimmy , and it really seems like the reason for that is that she cares for him deeply , but she cares for him enough that she has compromised herself in a way . Like you , I love seeing these two together . Bob and Rhea [ Seehorn ] have such chemistry together . There s such a playfulness and a knowingness to how they treat each other that I find fascinating . I ca n t take my eyes off them . I m so glad you agree . Of course , the better the romance goes , the more concerned I get , because we all have a feeling that this may not end well . We did n t see Kim Wexler on Breaking Bad . Even if she exists in Breaking Bad , it s very hard to imagine Kim Wexler being Saul Goodman s girlfriend . Just as Jimmy is trying to make a move forward during his suspension , it appears Chuck also is . It looks like he s going out to try to get help , like he really listened to what Howard was telling him . There s still some humor , of course . When he goes out to use the pay phone , he is like a Mylar-covered Rocky Balboa heading off to battle . But he does seem to be sincere in seeking out help right now . That s right . I m so glad you brought that up because , for us … and I love the way Michael McKean plays this character . It s astounding . That scene is a particular favorite of mine , because it is Chuck s hero s journey . He is going out into the world of electricity , and he is also going out in public with a space blanket over his head , which ca n t be easy for a man with so much pride . He is doing it to call the doctor . I love the way [ director ] Keith Gordon shot that scene . It s also a scene that Marshall Adams , our [ director of photography ] , shot in a different way . One of the things I m so proud of is that we have a man who has an allergy to electricity , and each one of the directors on the show has found a different way to communicate what it feels like to be Chuck . Earlier in the season , Dan Sackheim , in episode 5 , he actually used 35 mm film hand cranked and superimposed to communicate this . Here , Keith Gordon used heightened colors and heightened sounds to communicate this . It s a wonderful thing when you get to see these creative artists find different ways of communicating what it feels to be like Chuck McGill . It s so bright and colorful , and it really does give you a different feeling for Chuck , more empathy about just how intrusive and intense this condition must feel to him . Yes . Of course , Michael McKean is wonderful . You ll see more wonderful coming up from him , too . Howard is another standout in this episode . Throughout the series , he is someone who … viewers instincts may have been to write him off as this jerky , snooty , corporate guy , but we ve really gotten to see different pictures of him , different layers of him . When he goes to Chuck s house to deliver the news of the results of the hearing , he goes there with that $ 3,000 - $ 4,000 bottle of liquor . He has his own agendas , of course , and has to as the head of the law firm , but we really have come to see that he has some heart . He has some compassion for Chuck , for sure , some empathy for him . Again , he would do better if Chuck could get himself together and come back to the firm , but Howard seems to be sincere also in trying to get Chuck back on track with his whole life . I am beside myself that you bring this up because we grew to like Howard , and Patrick Fabian is doing such a spectacular job this season . In the editing room , the editors frequently say , Man , he is just great . And we ll sit there and watch so many things that he does to bring three dimensions to this character who , as you say , when we first met him at the beginning of Season 1 , seemed like just a stuffed shirt in contrast to Jimmy . Now we see that he does care for Chuck , but he s also depending on Chuck in some ways . They are law partners . He warned Chuck , really , in [ Chicanery ] , more or less warned Chuck not to take the stand it was unnecessary , and Chuck ignored him . Now he is giving Chuck some more good advice , and we ll see if Chuck is able to take it . I think it s revealing that Chuck wo n t allow Rebecca in the house , but Howard does get into the house . I think that Howard seems to be the one person who Chuck allows himself to show a tiny bit of vulnerability to . Just the littlest , tiny molecule of vulnerability . Watching these two together , [ McKean and Fabian ] really is a master class . They are wonderful . Also , Patrick is also just the nicest guy in the world , which , of course , really makes it a pleasure to work with him . Better Call Saul airs Mondays at 10 p.m. on AMC .
